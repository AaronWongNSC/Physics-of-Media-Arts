<div class="para"> The challenge of continuous data has been explored from at least the time of the ancient Greeks. There is a thought experiment known as the <dfn class="terminology">Arrow Paradox</dfn> that highlights the challenge of this. But we can think of this in terms of using a camera to film a moving object. Each frame of video captures a specific moment in time. But in each frame, the object is frozen in place. This means that in that moment, it doesn’t make sense to say that the object is moving because it has specific location at that time. If we have a faster camera, we can capture more moments of time in the movement, but even then there’s not a single moment where the motion is being captured, because each frame is still stationary. So there’s no way to actually capture movement at any moment in time, and so if you have no movements at all moments of time, then how does anything actually move? (A modern physics resolution is that motion is not what happens at a specific moment in time, but what happens between the moments of time.)</div>
