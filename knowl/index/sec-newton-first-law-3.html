<div class="para">An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by a net force.</div></article> <div class="para"> The basic idea is simple. Objects don’t just move arbitrarily. They move because something caused them to move. And if they are in motion, they will maintain that motion until something causes the motion to change. The tendency of objects to resist changing their motion (or lack of motion) is called <dfn class="terminology">inertia</dfn>. The amount of inertia an object has is known as its <dfn class="terminology">mass</dfn>. It’s very important to remember that mass and weight are not the same concept. Even in the weightlessness of outer space, objects will still have mass and will still resist your attempts to change their motion.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-newton-first-law.html#sec-newton-first-law-3">in-context</a></span>
