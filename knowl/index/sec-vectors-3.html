The first is a geometric representation and the second is an algebraic one. The geometric representation is great for building up intuition and an understandig of certain concepts, but it’s not so good for actually performing calculations. The algebraic representation is great for doing calculations, but it’s easy to lose track of the big picture when working with them. In the end, you will want to be familiar with both perspectives.</div> <div class="para">The most natural way to geometrically capture the concepts of direction and magnitude in a picture is by drawing an arrow. If we think about the arrow as an instruction that tells us which way to push an object, we can match our push so that it goes in the same direction as the arrow, and then the length of the arrow is  an indicator of how hard to push. A short arrow is a light push and a long arrow is a strong push. We can also translate this concept into the velocity of an object. The arrow says that the object is moving in that direction and we use its length to indicate how fast it’s going.</div> <div class="para"> We call the starting point of the arrow the <dfn class="terminology">tail</dfn> of the vector, and the tip of the arrow the <dfn class="terminology">head</dfn> of the vector. It’s important to note that the vector itself does not have a location. It only tells us about the relative positions of the starting and ending locations of the vector. In other words, we can slide the vector around the plane (without rotating it) and it doesn’t change the vector itself.</div> <div class="para"> The algebraic notation feels a lot like how we plot points in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> plane. A vector that points <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> spaces to the right and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> spaces up is denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\langle x, y \rangle\text{.}\)</span> Notice that the brackets are pointed rather than being round. This small shift in notation gives is what indicates the difference between a vector and a point. The <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> values are called the <dfn class="terminology">components</dfn> of the vector (or <dfn class="terminology">vector components</dfn>). More specifically, if the diagram is oriented in the "traditional" manner, the first component corresponds to the part of the vector that points in the horizontal direction, and the second component corresponds to the part of the vector that points in the vertical direction. There are more complicated ways to interpret the components of a vector, but we won’t be needing them for this class.</div> <div class="para"> If draw the vector with its tail at the origin, we say that the vector is in <dfn class="terminology">standard position</dfn>. In this case, the algebraic notation for the vector "matches" with the coordinates of the head. That is, when the vector <span class="process-math">\(\langle x, y \rangle\)</span> is drawn in standard position, the head of the vector will be located at the point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\text{.}\)</span> However, this only happens when the vector is in standard position. If the tail is somewhere else, then the head of the vector is found relative to the tail, and it will no longer correspond to the point.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-vectors.html#sec-vectors-3">in-context</a></span>
