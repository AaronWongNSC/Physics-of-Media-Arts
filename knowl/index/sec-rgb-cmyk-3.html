<div class="para"> RGB is the color scheme whose primary colors are red, green, and blue. The reason for this color combination is a matter of our human biology, and not some underlying physical principle. Our eyes simply have receptors that are mostly sensitive to those colors, and so this maximizes our responsiveness to this color scheme. Most importantly, this is an <dfn class="terminology">additive color</dfn> scheme, which means that we are starting from black (no photons) and increasing the number of photons that reach our eyes when we add these colors into the mix.</div>
<div class="para">If you were to take a very close look at your computer monitor or cellphone screen, you would see that each pixel is constructed from three subpixels. Unsurprisingly, the colors of those subpixels are red, green, and blue. The way that colors are produced is that those subpixels display at different levels of intensity. The itensity levels are usually given as a number from 0 to 255, where lower numbers mean lower levels of intensity. (If you have ever seen hex color codes, such as #A72EBD, you have seen this color system. The only difference is that the numbers are being represented in hexadecimal instead of using our usual decimal number system. If this were a math class, we’d talk about how hexadecmial works. But it’s not, so we’ll just direct you to search for a hexademical to decimal converter online.)</div>
<div class="para"> The ideas for this system go back to the 1920s when Technicolor developed their three strip system. At that time, film was only able to capture black-and-white. How can you use black-and-white film to capture color? The basic idea was to capture the footage three times, with one film capturing the reds, one film capturing the greens, and one film capturing the blues. Then the three layers can be put back together using red, green, and blue lights to reproduce the original image.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-rgb-cmyk.html#sec-rgb-cmyk-3">in-context</a></span>
