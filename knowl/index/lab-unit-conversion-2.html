<div class="para"> While most of the world and all of science operates using the metric system, daily life in the US usually revolves around the <dfn class="terminology">imperial system</dfn> of measurement. This is the system of quarts, gallons, feet, and miles that you’re probably most accustomed to seeing. In fact, there are only three countries in the world that officially operate on the imperial system! (The other two countries are Liberia and Myanmar.)</div>
<div class="para">The reason the imperial system is called that is because it was originally the system of units imposed on countries by the British Empire during the time of colonialism (imperial means "of the empire"). Somewhat confusingly, the imperial system wasn’t formalized until the 1820s. Before that, there was a vast array of customary measures used in various locations, some of which date back to the 1500s (and potentially even earlier).</div>
<div class="para">The actual origins of individual measurements were often rather arbitrary. For example, the length we call a foot today was originally the length of King Henry I’s foot. And an inch has been defined muliple ways, including the length of three grains of barley laid end-to-end and the length of twelve poppy seeds. There are also other historical measurements that are similarly arbitrary, such as a cubit (the length from your elbow to the tip of your outstretched middle finger) and a league (the distance a person can walk in an hour). Of course, differences in individual human bodies made these measurements to be rough estimates at best. And the convoluted history and origins of these measurements have led to the equally convoluted relationships between them, such as 5280 feet in a mile.</div>
<div class="para">For this lab, we are going to explore some more of the history of different units and practice making unit conversions using the imperial system.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="lab-unit-conversion.html#lab-unit-conversion-2">in-context</a></span>
