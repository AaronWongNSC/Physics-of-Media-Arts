<div class="para"> Joint and combined variations are variations with more than two variables. Technically, a <dfn class="terminology">joint variation</dfn> is a variation built from two direct variations. So the phrase "<span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> varies jointly with <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span>" means that <span class="process-math">\(A \propto BC\text{.}\)</span> (You will also see "<span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is proportional to <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span>".) This is different from a <dfn class="terminology">combined variation</dfn>, which is a combination of a direct variation and an inverse variation. Fortunately, the relationships are expressed explicitly in the language. For example, we would say "<span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> varies directly with <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and inversely with <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span>" to mean that <span class="process-math">\(A \propto \frac{B}{C}\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">With these types of variations, there is only one constant of proportionality. In other words, <span class="process-math">\(A \propto BC\)</span> means <span class="process-math">\(A = kBC\text{,}\)</span> as opposed to something like <span class="process-math">\(A = k_B B \cdot k_C C\text{.}\)</span> The reason for this that there is no benefit to introducing extra constants. In the end, the two constants can just be multiplied together into one, and we wouldnâ€™t be able to determine two separate constants without having to introduce another equation.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-variation-relationships.html#sec-variation-relationships-5">in-context</a></span>
