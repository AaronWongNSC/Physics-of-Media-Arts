<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Universal Gravity.</span></h1> <div class="para"> Here is a name you need to know: <dfn class="terminology">Sir Isaac Newton</dfn>. He could rightly be considered the first real physicist, and his name is on a wide range of physics concepts (including the laws of physics, which gives you a true sense of his importance to the field). Although a lot of work was done on the topic of gravity before he came along, he was the first to formalize it and give it its universal interpretation.</div> <article class="definition definition-like"><h2 class="heading">

</h2>  <div class="para">Each particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is proportional to the their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</div></article> <div class="para">Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation phrases the ideas in terms of the "force" between objects, but we haven’t talked about what that means. So we’re going to modify the statement slightly so that it is framed in terms of acceleration. It should be noted that this formulation, while perfectly consistent with Newton’s ideas, usually does not appear as a separate concept like we are doing here.</div> <article class="definition definition-like"><h2 class="heading">
<span class="type">Definition</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">5.3.0.2</span><span class="period">.</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="title">Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitational Acceleration.</span>
</h2>  <div class="para">Each particle in the universe causes every other particle in the universe to accelerate towards it with an acceleration that is proportional to the first particle’s mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</div></article> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para"> From the phrasing of the relationship, we can see that the formula for acceleration is the following:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
a = \frac{G \cdot M}{r^2}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is the constant of proportionality, <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is the mass of the object causing the acceleration, and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the distance between the two objects. The constant of proportionality is called the <dfn class="terminology">gravitational constant</dfn>. Although Newton described this constant in 1687, it wasn’t directly measured until Henry Cavendish did it in 1798. The modern accepted value for this is <span class="process-math">\(6.672 \times 10^{-11} \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2\text{.}\)</span> (Recall that the unit <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> represents Newtons and has units of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}}{\text{s}^2}\text{.}\)</span>)</div>
