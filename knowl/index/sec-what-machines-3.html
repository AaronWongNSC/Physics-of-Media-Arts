<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Mechanical Advantage.</span></h1>
<div class="para"> The mechanical advantage of a machine is how much the machine multiplies the input force. For example, if a force of 10 N into a machine results in an output force of 20 N, the mechanical advantage of 2:1. It is possible for machines to have very large mechanical advantages. For example, a car jack takes forces generate by human arms to lift a vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds.</div>
<div class="para">The tradeoff of mechanical advantage is usually a tradoff between force and distance. For example, if you are using a pulley system that gives you a 10:1 mechanical advantage, it might be that you are getting 10 times the force in the output, but itâ€™s only going to move 1/10 of the distance.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-what-machines.html#sec-what-machines-3">in-context</a></span>
