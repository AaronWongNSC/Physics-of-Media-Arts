<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Unit Conversions.</span></h1>
<div class="para"> Unit conversions are a particular manipulation that is important to understand and execute. The main concept is that any relationship between two units can be expressed as a ratio that is equivalent to the number 1 (which is called a <dfn class="terminology">conversion factor</dfn>), and then multiplying any quantity by 1 does not change it. From here, it’s just a matter of doing algebra on the units to complete the conversion</div>
<div class="para">Creating a conversion factor simply requires us to write a relationship as an equation, and then writing a fraction with one side as the numerator and the other side as the denominator. The arrangement that you will want will depend on the calculation you are doing.</div>

</h2></summary><article class="example example-like knowl__content"><div class="para">Consider the relationship "12 inches is a foot." If we were to write this as an equation, it would look like this: <span class="process-math">\(12 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ foot}\text{.}\)</span> This means that the two conversion factors we could create are <span class="process-math">\(\frac{12 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ foot}}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}}\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Another example would be the relationship "60 seconds in a minute." The equation would be <span class="process-math">\(60 \text{ seconds} = 1 \text{ minute}\text{,}\)</span> so that the conversion factors are <span class="process-math">\(\frac{60 \text{ seconds}}{1 \text{ minute}}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1 \text{ minute}}{60 \text{ seconds}}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></article></details><div class="para">To choose which conversion factor to use, you need to think about how you would cancel the units. It turns out that units cancel out like numbers and variables in fractions. This means setting up the fraction so that the unit you want to eliminate is on the opposite side of the fraction (numerator and denominator) of the original.</div>
<div class="para">Once the conversion factor has been chosen, it is an exercise in multiplying by fractions to complete the calculation. You can treat the number parts independently of the units. If you are converting multiple units, you can either do them all at once, or do it one step at a time. If you are less confident with your mathematical skills, it’s probably better to do one unit at a time. (Note: We treat the singular and plural of a unit to be the same thing, so that, for example, second would cancel with seconds.)</div>

</h2></summary><article class="example example-like knowl__content"><div class="para">Suppose we wanted to convert 144 inches to feet. We would start by identifying the relationship <span class="process-math">\(12 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ foot}\text{.}\)</span> Then we would need to decide how to get the inches to cancel out. Since inches are currently in the numerator, we would want our conversion factor to have the inches in the denominator. That leads us to pick <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}}\text{.}\)</span> The rest is just arithmetic and algebra.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
144 \text{ inches} \amp = 144 \text{ inches} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}}\\
\amp = \frac{144 \cdot 1}{12} \frac{\text{inches} \cdot \text{ foot}}{\text{inches}}\\

</h2></summary><article class="example example-like knowl__content"><div class="para">Suppose we wanted to convert 10 kilometers per hour to meters per second. We would need two relationships. One to convert kilometers to meters, and another to convert hours to seconds. The first relationship is <span class="process-math">\(1000 \text{ meters} = 1 \text{ km}\text{.}\)</span> (We will talk about the system of prefixes in the next chapter.) Perhaps you know how many seconds there are in an hour, but how would you do it if you didn’t? This will require multiple conversions.</div>
<div class="para">The two relevant relationships are that there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. We can see that seconds and hours can be related to each other through minutes. The key idea here is that we can multiply conversion factors together to get another conversion factor. Specifically, we have the following:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{60 \text{ s}}{1 \text{ min}} \cdot \frac{60 \text{ min}}{1 \text{ hr}} = \frac{3600 \text{ s}}{1 \text{ hr}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This conversion factor tells us that there are 3600 seconds in an hour. This gives us the second conversion factor we need. We will do the calculation in steps, and then do it all at once. We will first convert km/hr to m/hr.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
10 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{hr}} \amp = 10 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{hr}} \cdot \frac{1000 \text{ m}}{1 \text{ km}} \\
\amp = (10 \cdot 1000) \frac{\text{km} \cdot \text{m}}{\text{km} \cdot \text{hr}} \\
\amp = 10000 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{hr}} 
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">Now we will convert m/hr to m/s.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
10000 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{hr}} \amp = 10000 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{hr}} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ hr}}{3600 \text{ s}} \\
\amp = \frac{10000}{3600} \frac{\text{m} \cdot \text{hr}}{\text{hr} \cdot \text{s}} \\
\amp \approx 2.7778 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} 
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">Doing the calculation all at once looks like this:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
10 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{hr}} \amp 10 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{hr}} \cdot \frac{1000 \text{ m}}{1 \text{ km}} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ hr}}{3600 \text{ s}} \\
\amp = \frac{10 \cdot 1000}{3600} \frac{\text{km} \cdot \text{m} \cdot \text{hr}}{\text{hr} \cdot \text{km} \cdot \text{s}} \\
\amp \approx 2.7778 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
