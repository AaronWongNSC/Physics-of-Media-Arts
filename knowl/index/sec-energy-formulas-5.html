<div class="para"> Elastic potential energy is the potential energy stored in a spring that has either been compressed or stretched from its <dfn class="terminology">natural length</dfn> (which is the length of the spring when itâ€™s just left alone). The formula for elastic potential energy for basic springs is <span class="process-math">\(U = \frac{kx^2}{2}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is known as the spring constant and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is the change in length from the natural length. The spring constant is a value that basically measures the stiffness of the spring. When the spring constant is large, it requires a lot of effort to stretch or compress it.</div>
<div class="para">Springs can be an entire chapter on their own due to the fact that we can use springs as a model for a range of behaviors in physics. We are going to look at just a small piece of the picture. Imagine that you have a spring with one end attached to the ceiling and the other end hanging downward. Now imagine putting a small weight on the end of the spring, pulling it downward a bit, and then letting it go. What do you think is going to happen?</div>
<div class="para"> You should be anticipating that the weight will bounce up and down. But if we ignore friction and look more closely, what we will see is energy conservation in action. As the spring reaches its shortest and longest lengths, the mass is coming to a rest, leading to there being no kinetic energy. At those moments, all of the energy is stored up in the spring as potential energy. As the spring starts to move back towards its equilibrium length, the mass picks up speed and the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. And this back-and-forth behavior is known as simple harmonic osciallation, and it will continue forever because we are ignoring friction.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-energy-formulas.html#sec-energy-formulas-5">in-context</a></span>
