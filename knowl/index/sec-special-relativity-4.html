<div class="para"> To start to understand what this means, we need to do some simple thought experiments. Let’s say that you have a gun that shoots a pellet at a speed of 20 miles per hour. And let’s say that you’re shooting this from a car that is traveling at 50 miles per hour. If you are shooting the gun forward, how fast will the pellet go (ignoring air resistance)? You would likely say that it’s traveling at 70 miles per hour, 50 miles per hour from the car plus 20 miles per hour from the gun. This is know as <dfn class="terminology">classical velocity addition</dfn>.</div>
