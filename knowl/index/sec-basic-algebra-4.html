<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Unit Conversions.</span></h1> <div class="para"> Unit conversions are a particular manipulation that is important to understand and execute. The main concept is that any relationship between two units can be expressed as a ratio that is equivalent to the number 1 (which is called a <dfn class="terminology">conversion factor</dfn>), and then multiplying any quantity by 1 does not change it. From here, it’s just a matter of doing algebra on the units to complete the conversion</div> <div class="para">Creating a conversion factor simply requires us to write a relationship as an equation, and then writing a fraction with one side as the numerator and the other side as the denominator. The arrangement that you will want will depend on the calculation you are doing.</div> <details class="example example-like born-hidden-knowl"><summary class="knowl__link"><h2 class="heading">

</h2></summary><article class="example example-like knowl__content"> <div class="para">Consider the relationship "12 inches is a foot." If we were to write this as an equation, it would look like this: <span class="process-math">\(12 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ foot}\text{.}\)</span> This means that the two conversion factors we could create are <span class="process-math">\(\frac{12 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ foot}}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Another example would be the relationship "60 seconds in a minute." The equation would be <span class="process-math">\(60 \text{ seconds} = 1 \text{ minute}\text{,}\)</span> so that the conversion factors are <span class="process-math">\(\frac{60 \text{ seconds}}{1 \text{ minute}}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1 \text{ minute}}{60 \text{ seconds}}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></article></details> <div class="para">To choose which conversion factor to use, you need to think about how you would cancel the units. It turns out that units cancel out like numbers and variables in fractions. This means setting up the fraction so that the unit you want to eliminate is on the opposite side of the fraction (numerator and denominator) of the original.</div> <div class="para">Once the conversion factor has been chosen, it is an exercise in multiplying by fractions to complete the calculation. You can treat the number parts independently of the units. If you are converting multiple units, you can either do them all at once, or do it one step at a time. If you are less confident with your mathematical skills, it’s probably better to do one unit at a time. (Note: We treat the singular and plural of a unit to be the same thing, so that, for example, second would cancel with seconds.)</div> <details class="example example-like born-hidden-knowl"><summary class="knowl__link"><h2 class="heading">

</h2></summary><article class="example example-like knowl__content"> <div class="para">Suppose we wanted to convert 144 inches to feet. We would start by identifying the relationship <span class="process-math">\(12 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ foot}\text{.}\)</span> Then we would need to decide how to get the inches to cancel out. Since inches are currently in the numerator, we would want our conversion factor to have the inches in the denominator. That leads us to pick <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}}\text{.}\)</span> The rest is just arithmetic and algebra.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
144 \text{ inches} \amp = 144 \text{ inches} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}}\\
\amp \frac{144}{12} \frac{\text{inches} \cdot \text{ foot}}{\text{inches}}\\
