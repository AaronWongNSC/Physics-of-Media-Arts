<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Air Resistance.</span></h1> <div class="para">We are going to add some air resistance to the gravity example. Now as the object is falling, it’s also experiencing air resistance. This can be thought of as the impact of the object bumping into molecules of as it falls. As it falls faster, it bumps into more air, and so it experiences more resistance.</div> <div class="para">The free body diagram now has two forces. Gravity is still pulling it downward, but now there’s also an upward force that we can call <span class="process-math">\(F_{\text{air}}\text{.}\)</span> The size of this force will depend on a number of factors, such as the weight and shape of the object. An object that is more streamline in the direction of motion will hit fewer air molecules than something that is bulky in that direction. But regardless of the shape, there is some amount of upward force from the air.</div> <div class="para"> There is a specific when the force of gravity perfectly matches the force of air resistance. This is known as <dfn class="terminology">terminal velocity</dfn>. When an object is falling at terminal velocity, there is zero net force on the object because the two forces are perfectly cancelling each other out. This means that there is no acceleration, which means that the object’s motion is unchanging (Newton’s First Law), and the object will remain at this velocity until something changes.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-forces.html#sec-forces-4">in-context</a></span>
