<div class="para"> The vibrations of light are typically oriented randomly. That is, each photon that arrives is vibrating in its own random direction, so that when you have lots of photons there is no coherence to the vibrations you are seeing. This is known as <dfn class="terminology">unpolarized light</dfn>. Most of the light you encounter is unpolarized. It takes special conditions to get the light waves to become oriented in some type of meaningful pattern to become <dfn class="terminology">polarized light</dfn> The most common types of polarized light in applications are linearly and circularly polarized light.</div>
