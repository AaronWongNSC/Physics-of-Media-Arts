<div class="para">A graph consists of points, lines, and curves plotted in a two-dimensional grid. Each direction represents a different variable. Points are named using the convention of an ordered pair <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\text{,}\)</span> where the horizontal variable is listed first, followed by the vertical variable. Although the variables <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> were used in this example, we are not limited to that choice of variable. In many cases, we will have time on the horizontal axis, which is usually denoted with the variable <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">There are two types of data that we will be working with: discrete and continuous. Discrete data means that we are picking specific values of the variables to plot. For example, we might be measuring the position of an object after 0 seconds, 1 second, 2 seconds, and 3 seconds. This leaves a gap of time where we don’t have data. For example, we would have to guess the position of the object at 1.5 seconds. Continuous data means that the data does not have those gaps. Technically, any time we gather data we will have discrete data, but there are certainly situations where the data points are close enough that we treat the data as being practically continuous.</div>
<div class="para"> The challenge of continuous data has been explored from at least the time of the ancient Greeks. There is a thought experiment known as the <dfn class="terminology">Arrow Paradox</dfn> that highlights the challenge of this. But we can think of this in terms of using a camera to film a moving object. Each frame of video captures a specific moment in time. But in each frame, the object is frozen in place. This means that in that moment, it doesn’t make sense to say that the object is moving because it has specific location at that time. If we have a faster camera, we can capture more moments of time in the movement, but even then there’s not a single moment where the motion is being captured, because each frame is still stationary. So there’s no way to actually capture movement at any moment in time, and so if you have no movements at all moments of time, then how does anything actually move? (A modern physics resolution is that motion is not what happens at a specific moment in time, but what happens between the moments of time.)</div>
