<div class="para">These formulas assume that we’ve removed the effect of air resistance. But it’s worth thinking about what would happen if we looked at more realistic physics that takes air resistance into account.</div>
<div class="para">The first observation to make is that objects are not likely to go as high or as far. The reason is that the air resistance will tend to slow down the motion of the projectile. You can see this in practice by throwing a crumpled piece of paper. Unless the paper is wadded up very tightly, it will not go as far as you would expect when you throw it.</div>
<div class="para"> Another feature of adding air resistance is that there is a <dfn class="terminology">terminal velocity</dfn> for falling objects. In the acceleration model we developed, there’s no limit to how fast something falls. However, the reality is that moving through the air will cause objects to reach a maximum speed when falling. Conceptually, you can think of this being the result of the object having to push air molecules out of the way, which takes away from the speed that it can attain.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-projectile-motion.html#sec-projectile-motion-6">in-context</a></span>
