<div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Visible light</dfn> is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can detect. It turns out that this is a tiny sliver of the entire electromagnetic spectrum. We typically describe the photons in this range by their wavelengths, which span from approximately 380 to 700 nm. It is important to recognize that the cutoff is based on our biology, and not some larger physical principle. There are other creates in the animal world that can detect wavelengths that go outside of what we can see, and so their "visible light" would be a different range.</div>
