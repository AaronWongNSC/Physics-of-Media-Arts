<div class="para">In the previous section, we talked about how different wavelengths of light generate different colors. However, we did not say that every color that we see is the result of a particular wavelength of light. You will not find pink or brown in the rainbow. So where does it come from?</div>
<div class="para"> A device known as a <dfn class="terminology">spectrophotometer</dfn> can be used to measure the amounts of all of the incoming wavelengths of light. These can generate graphs (called the "spectral power distribution") that will show peaks around the wavelengths of light that are the most common when viewing an object. While we could say that these graphs can "define" colors for us, and this would be a very scientific and concrete way to understand colors, this isn’t what actually happens in our heads. Our eyes are simply not as sophisticated, and we aren’t able to isolate the exact wavelengths of lights in that way. All we have are our three colors of cones. This means that our understanding of color is going to be much simpler.</div>
<div class="para">The solution our brains have developed is that it invents new colors for us to see when we’re seeing mixtures of wavelengths at the same time in the same spot. So if the red and blue cones are being activated in the same spot, our brains create a color that we call magenta to try to tell us that this is a mixture of colors.</div>
<div class="para">An important fact about our color perception is that it depends on the level of activation of the cones, and not the actual wavelengths of light that are hitting them. So we might perceive two colors to be the same even if the spectral power distributions are different.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-color-space.html#sec-color-space-3">in-context</a></span>
