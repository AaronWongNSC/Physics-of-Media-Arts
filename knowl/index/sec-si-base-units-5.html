<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Kilograms.</span></h1> <div class="para"> A <dfn class="terminology">kilogram</dfn> is a unit of mass. <dfn class="terminology">Mass</dfn> is a somewhat complicated quantity to measure because it gets mixed up with a related but different concept of <dfn class="terminology">weight</dfn>. The mass is basically the amount of matter in the object. If there’s more mass in one object than another, it means that there’s more matter in that object compared to the other. But how would we know how much matter there is? Our first intuition might be to weight it, and then we can say that there’s more matter in the one that weighs more. This leads to the correct conclusion, but it’s deceptive about the nature of matter.</div> <div class="para"> You might be familiar with the idea that objects weigh less on the moon than they do on earth, and this is related to the concept of <dfn class="terminology">gravity</dfn>. Since the gravity changes from one location to another, it makes it hard to really use gravity as the way to determine mass. In fact, if we were to put objects into orbit on the <dfn class="terminology">International Space Station</dfn> (or ISS), we could not use weight at all since everything would weigh nothing! So a better concept of mass is to think about <dfn class="terminology">inertia</dfn>, which is a measure of how hard it is to change the motion of something. Even though objects have no weight in space, it still takes a certain amount of effort to move them. Objects with more mass are harder to move than objects with less mass. And the difficulty of moving an object (not its weight) is what we should be thinking of when we think about mass.</div> <div class="para">You might have noticed that we haven’t given the definition of a kilogram yet. That’s because the definition is connected to a quantity known as Planck’s constant <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> This is the number that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency. But to understand what that means, we would have to get into quantum mechanics, and that’s just a lot to take in. So it’s better to just hold the concept of mass without worrying about its formal definition.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-si-base-units.html#sec-si-base-units-5">in-context</a></span>
