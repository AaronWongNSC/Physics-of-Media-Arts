<div class="para">The purpose of color spaces is that provides us a framework for understanding how colors can be translated through the in-between layer.</div>
<div class="para">On the recording end, we need to be able to understand and interpret the data we are collecting. If we had two color sensors where each one only detected a single wavelength of light, then the only colors that we would be able to record would be on the line connecting the two points on the boundary corresponding to those wavelengths. In other words, the color space that the camera could access is limited, and it will be unable to reproduce colors outside of that range. This example is mostly theoretical because modern technology doesn’t have this type of limitation, but it is an important conceptual point to help understand the next part.</div>
<div class="para">On the reproducing end, things are quite a bit more complicated. To keep our discussion as simple as possible, we will focus on RGB color schemes, which are used for electronic monitor displays (desktops, phones, tablets). These displays can really only create three distinct colors of light, namely red, green, and blue. But exactly which colors it generates depends on the specifics of how the electronics are set up. You might be familiar with trying to calibrate a monitor by turning the brightness up or down, or adjusting the contrast. Regardless of the specifics, there is a particular color of red, green, and blue that are generated, and those colors are located somewhere on thee color space. Once those three colors are identified, the only colors that can be displayed live inside of the triangle formed by those three points.</div>
<div class="para">The goal is to have the colors collected by the recording end to be perfectly matched up with the colors generaeted on the reproducing end. And the only way this can happen is if there is agreement about what the colors are. And this is where the various standards came from. The following diagram shows three common color spaces:</div>

It also shows how using the wrong standard on your display relative to the camera can lead to poor results. For example, if your camera is set to Adobe RGB but your computer is set to interpret the data as sRGB, you will find that your greens are a little more yellow. This is because the camera’s concept of green is more green than green of sRGB. And this is why it is important to make sure that you are using the same settings on both sides of the process.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-color-space.html#sec-color-space-6">in-context</a></span>
