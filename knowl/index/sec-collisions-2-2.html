<div class="para"> We will be using the principle of conservation of momentum to analyze what happens in collisions. This topic is usually presented with a discussion of the energy of the system, which breaks the world of collisions into two categories. If no energy is lost, then the collision is said to be <dfn class="terminology">elastic</dfn>. These types of collisions basically do not exist in reality, and are considered to be a theoretical ideal. A collision in which energy is lost is said to be <dfn class="terminology">inelastic</dfn>. The ways that energy would typically be lost would be through heat and sound, and while we say that the energy is lost, itâ€™s more correct to say that the energy has been converted into another form that cannot be accounted for in the motion of the particles.</div>
