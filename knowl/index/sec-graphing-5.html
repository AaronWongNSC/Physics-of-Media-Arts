<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Interpolation and Extrapolation.</span></h1>  <div class="para">When working with discrete data, there are two important concepts to understand for trying to interpret the graph. Interpolation is the process of estimating the values in between measured points in the data, and extrapolation is the process of estimating the values beyond the measured points in the data. Interpolation is often accomplished by using "straight-line" estimates, meaning that you imagine drawing a straight line between the data points and then using that line to estimate the values of the function.</div> <div class="para">Extrapolation is much more complicated. It requires a sense of how the function behaves. Using a straight line to estimate a function that is more parabolic can lead to significant errors. It can also lead to answers that do not make sense. This is a place where graphs give way to formulas and theoretical considerations. We will not encounter these types of situations too frequently in this course, but itâ€™s important to understand the idea.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-graphing.html#sec-graphing-5">in-context</a></span>
