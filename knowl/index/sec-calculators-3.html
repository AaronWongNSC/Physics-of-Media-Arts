<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Order of Operations.</span></h1>
<div class="para">One of the main errors (aside from pressing the wrong button) that can arise is when the desired calculation and the calculation that the calculator understands are not in alignment with each other. These are some of the most difficult errors to identify on the fly because your only indication that something went wrong is that the number is wrong. In some situations, the number you get is "obviously" wrong (such as getting a negative number when you know you should be getting a positive number). But the most common result is that a student dutifully copies the number the calculator gives them onto their paper, then moves forward from there without the slightest bit of hesitation.</div>
<div class="para"> Underneath this problem is an understanding of the <dfn class="terminology">order of operations</dfn>. When used in the mathematical context, this is interpreted as PEMDAS (Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally) or BOMDAS, which is understood to be a set of rules for how to interpret a mathematical expression. More broadly, however, it just means the order in which you do things. For example, socks-before-shoes is an order of operations. The reason we need to think about this broader sense is because not all calculators understand the mathematical order of operations the way that it’s set up in mathematics.</div>
<div class="para">Consider the calculation <span class="process-math">\(1 + 2 \times 3\text{.}\)</span> You would probably immediately recognize that you need to do the multiplication before the addition, and get the mathematically correct result of 7. But in order for you to know that, you had to see the whole problem before you strated. You had to know that the multiplication was at the end, and you used that information to determine how you were going to do the computation. Some calculators have this ability, but others do not.</div>
<div class="para"> Some calculators use the <dfn class="terminology">immediate execution</dfn> method of computation. This means that it tries to do the calculation as you type it in. And even within this category, there are calculators that can hold values in memory and those that can’t. Let’s analyze how one of these calculators might see this calculation.</div>
<ul class="disc" id="sec-calculators-3-6">
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\boxed{1}\text{:}\)</span> The calculator understands that you’re starting to type in a number. As long as you keep typing in digits, it will keep thinking that you’re still typing in the number.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\boxed{+}\text{:}\)</span> You’ve now pressed a mathematical operation, so it knows that you’re done with the first number. The next thing it is expecting is another number.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\boxed{2}\text{:}\)</span> Just as with the first step, as long as you’re typing in numbers, it’s waiting for you to finish telling it the number.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\boxed{\times}\text{:}\)</span> At this point, things can go in one of two ways. Some calculators will understand that you’re done with the second number of the sum and do that calculation right away. Then it will use that result with the multiplication that you’re about to give it. On the other hand, some calculators know about the mathematical order of operations, and it will know that it needs to do this multiplication first, then go back and add the other result. But in order to do that, it will also need to hold that original 1 in memory.</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">While there is more to the calculation, this is the critical step where things can fall apart. And this is why it’s critical for you to know how your calculator works. Lots of students get problems wrong because of something as simple as this.</div>
<div class="para"> It’s worth noting that there are some calculators that take the whole expression in before doing the calculation. These are sometimes called <dfn class="terminology">infix notation</dfn> calculators. These behave more like how you would behave when looking at a calculation. You would use a logical system to determine which calculation needs to be performed first based on the order of operations, and then you would simplify from there. But infix notation also has order of operations pitfalls.</div>
<div class="para">Consider the calculation <span class="process-math">\(\frac{5}{2+3}\text{.}\)</span> You can easily see that this is equal to 1. But if you don’t type it into the calculator correctly, it won’t give you the desired result. Here is the button sequences that students would typically press: <span class="process-math">\(\boxed{\strut 5}\boxed{\div}\boxed{2}\boxed{+}\boxed{3}\text{.}\)</span> And some students might even see <span class="process-math">\(5/2+3\)</span> in the display and feel as though everything is correct. But how would the calculator see it?</div>
<div class="para">The calculator is programmed to try to follow the order of operations, and so it will scan through the different operations to help it determine the order in which it will do the calculations. Based on this, it will see the division symbol and prioritize that one. This would lead to the first calculation being <span class="process-math">\(5 \div 2 = 2.5\text{.}\)</span> This will be added to 3, giving 5.5 as the result.</div>
<div class="para">The problem is now clear. You need to tell the calculator that the <span class="process-math">\(2+3\)</span> is all in the denominator for the division calculation. The way to do this is to use parentheses (which most infix calculators have). Once you type it as <span class="process-math">\(\boxed{\strut 5}\boxed{\div}\boxed{(}\boxed{2}\boxed{+}\boxed{3}\boxed{)}\text{,}\)</span> it will give you the correct result.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-calculators.html#sec-calculators-3">in-context</a></span>
