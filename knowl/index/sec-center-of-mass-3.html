<div class="para"> This entire discussion of momentum so far has side-stepped a very important concept known as the <dfn class="terminology">center of mass</dfn> of the object (or system of objects). The center of mass has a particular formula for how to calculate it, but the basic idea is that it’s the balance point of the object.</div>
<div class="para">We have implicitly been treating the objects as individual points with no dimension, but real objects are not like that. They are composed of many different parts that are connected to each other, all the way down to the level of individual atoms. And when two objects collide, different parts of the object experience that collision differently. This can lead to very complicated physics models and equations.</div>
<div class="para">There is some good news. All of the physics we’ve done so far is completely valid for modeling the behavior of the center of mass of an object. That is, if we look at our equations  and only focus on the center of mass, everything we have done will be completely correct. So we have the correct analysis for the general behavior of objects.</div>
<div class="para">But there is also some bad news. The dynamics we’ve been talking about do not take into account some of the more intricate behaviors of the constituent pieces. A basic example would a bolo ball (which is a piece of string with a ball tied to each end). If you were to throw a bolo ball, the center of mass would follow a nice parabolic trajectory, but the two balls might be spinning all over the place. The work that we’ve done is not enough to account for the individual behavior of the two balls. We can only work with the center of mass.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-center-of-mass.html#sec-center-of-mass-3">in-context</a></span>
