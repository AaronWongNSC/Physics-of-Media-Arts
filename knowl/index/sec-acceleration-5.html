<div class="para">Acceleration is more a more complicated value, and it requires more information for us to determine it from positions. Let’s imagine that we have a movie. If we look at any particular frame by itself, we won’t be able to measure either velocity or acceleration. That single instant of time does not give us the information we need. If we were to look one frame later, would could see changes in the position, which would allow us to get the velocity. However, that is only a single velocity value. In order to see a change in velocity, we have to look at a third frame so that we can measure the velocity between frames the second two frames, and then see how that velocity is changing.</div>
<div class="para"> While this multi-layered calculation is often required, we have other tools that measure acceleration. Such tools are known as <dfn class="terminology">accelerometers</dfn>. There are digital devices that do this, but while those devices are great for data collection, they also hide all of the concepts inside of the circuitry, and so it’s harder to understand what’s happening. So we will think about the classic analog accelerometer. You should imagine a clear tube with a ball in the middle that is connected to the top and bottom of the tube by springs. If you hold the tube vertically and motionless for a while, the ball will eventually settle into what is known as the "equilibrium position", which is what gives us our reference point. If you lift the tube upward quickly, you should be able to intuitively see that the ball will initially shift downward relative to the tube. This is how it indicates an upward acceleration. Similarly, (after letting it reach equilirbrium again) if you lower the tube quickly, the ball will shift upward. This gives the basic idea for how these devices work.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-acceleration.html#sec-acceleration-5">in-context</a></span>
