<div class="para">Some calculators are capable of handling scientific notation. You would want to look for a button that has an EE or EXP on it, and you would want to find a tutorial (or experiment with the calculator) to make sure that you understand how to use it properly. But while you could use such a calculator to do your calculations, it is still important to understand the basic algebra that goes on behind it.</div>
<div class="para">The key idea that we use is that when we have products and quotients (but not sums and differences), we can do the arithmetic in any order we want and still get the same answer. (Technically the last fact is a combination of two algebraic properties known as the <dfn class="terminology">commutative property</dfn> and the <dfn class="terminology">associative property</dfn> of multiplication.) The procedure we will follow is to multiply and/or divide all of the coefficients and all of the exponent terms separately, and then combine the results in the end.</div>
<div class="para"> This is a good time to raise a point about significant figures. A system of <dfn class="terminology">significant figures</dfn> represents a method for tracking the level of meaningful accuracy of the digits in a calculation. One of the great challenges in empirical work is that measurements are inherently imprecise. (We’ll talk a little more about this in a later section.) If your digital scale might read 13 grams, but you won’t really know whether the weight is closer to 12.6 grams or 13.4 grams. And so the 13 grams is actually just an estimate. When multiple values in a calculation are estimates, it can often be useful to keep track of the level of the estimate, and this is done through significant figures.</div>
<div class="para">The general idea is that you can track significant figures in scientific notation by counting the number of decimal points there are in the representations and doing some bookkeeping with those values. For our purposes, we’re going to skip this and just generally aim to keep at least 4 decimals. Although there are some useful ideas that can be developed in terms of really thinking through the concept of computational errors, it’s a little bit off target for the big picture goals that we’re looking for. (If you wish to pursue this further, there is a link below.)</div>
