<div class="para"> The idea of two variables being "in proportion" to each other is that they form a constant ratio. This is known as a <dfn class="terminology">direct variation</dfn>. A simple example is purchasing items (without a bulk discount). If a burger is $4, then 2 burgers is $8, 3 burgers is $12, and so on. The ratio of number of burgers to the cost remains the same. There are two mathematical phrasings that capture this type of relationship. The first is "<span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is proportional to <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span>" and the other is "<span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> varies directly with (or as) <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>" As an equation, this is often written as <span class="process-math">\(A \propto B\text{,}\)</span> which means that <span class="process-math">\(A = kB\)</span> for some constant <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> This constant is known as the <dfn class="terminology">constant of proportionality</dfn>.</div>
<div class="para">When two variables are directly proportional to each other, it establishes a linear relationship between them. This means that if one increases, so does the other, and always in an equal proportion of the amount of increase. This type of relationship appears throughout physics, though it usually requires assuming that certain other variables are being held constant. Here are a few examples (and don’t worry if you don’t understand them right now):</div>
<ul class="disc" id="sec-variation-relationships-3-4">
<li><div class="para">Distance is proportional to the time traveled (at a constant speed): <span class="process-math">\(d \propto t\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Voltage is proportional to the current (with a constant resistance): <span class="process-math">\(V \propto I\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Force is proportional to the accerlation (with a constant mass): <span class="process-math">\(F \propto a\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">The reason for the <span class="process-math">\(\propto\)</span> notation is that we don’t always care about the value of the constant of proportionality. It emphasizes the variables in the relationship without needing to introduce another symbol that would need to be defined or discussed. However, when it comes to working through problems, we almost always see that constant of proportionality show up.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-variation-relationships.html#sec-variation-relationships-3">in-context</a></span>
