<div class="para">Levers come in three types, depending on the relative locations of the fulcrum, the effort, and the load.</div>
<div class="para"> If the effort is on the opposite side of the fulcrum as the load, then it is a <dfn class="terminology">first class lever</dfn>. This is the classic type of seesaw pattern that most people think of when it comes to levers. Whether there is a mechanical advantage in this case will depend on the distances between the fulcrum and the load or the effort.</div>
<div class="para"> If the load is between the fulcrum and the effort, then it is a <dfn class="terminology">second class lever</dfn>. An example of this type of lever is a wheelbarrow. In that case, the fulcrum is the part that attaches to the wheel, the load is the barrel, and then you lift the handles that stick beyond the barrel. In this case, there will always be a mechanical advantage because the distance from the fulcrum to the effort will always be larger than the distance from the fulcrum to the load.</div>
<div class="para"> If the effort is between the fulcrum and the load, then it is a <dfn class="terminology">third class lever</dfn>. An example of this type of lever is a broom. The fulcrum is the tip of the handle, the effort is where you push the broom handle to sweep, and the load (the stuff being swept) is all the way at the head of the broom. The benefit of this type of lever is that you are multiplying distance rather than multiplying force. Since the objects being swept are light, the force that your body can generate is much greater than necessary to move them. The broom allows you to move your hands a couple dozen centimeteres but move dirt and dust on the floor more than a meter.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-lever.html#sec-lever-4">in-context</a></span>
