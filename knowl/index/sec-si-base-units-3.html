<div class="para"> A <dfn class="terminology">second</dfn> is a unit of time. Measuring the passage of time is something that we use in our daily lives and the second is the smallest common unit of time that we use for that purpose. But the technical definition of a second is somewhat surprising. The statement below is taken from the <a class="external" href="https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si-brochure/SI-Brochure-9.pdf" target="_blank">9th edition of the "SI brochure"</a><details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="sec-si-base-units-3-2-4"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 3.1"><sup> 1 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="sec-si-base-units-3-2-4"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si-brochure/SI-Brochure-9.pdf</code></div></details>:</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="para">[The second] is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, <span class="process-math">\(\Delta_{\nu_{\text{Cs}}}\text{,}\)</span> the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to <span class="process-math">\(\text{s}^{-1}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="para">What does this mean? Basically, it means that a second is <em class="emphasis">defined</em> by watching an atom and counting how quickly it bounces back and forth between two states. After about 9 billion of those transitions have occured, we say that a second has passed.</div>
<div class="para">Historically, seconds have been a subdivision of a long unit of time. You would take a day, break it into 24 hours, break each hour into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds, and that would result in having a second be <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{86400}\)</span> of a day. The problem with this definition is that a day is not a fixed unit of time. It turns out that the spin of the earth is decreasing at a rate of about 1.8 milliseconds every century (and this is only an average). This means that our measurements would be slowly shifting as well, and that’s not what we want to see out of our science.</div>
<div class="para">At a deeper level, it ties our concept of time to something that’s not consistently measurable. If we were able to get a consistent and perfectly exact measurement of a day (and this time period is something that never changes), then we could theoretically tie our calculations to it. But we can’t, and so scientists have tried to come up with something that they think would satisfy the requirements.</div>
<aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">While this may seem random, we have used vibrations of quartz crystals to keep consistent time since the 1940s. And that was the start of the pathway that has taken us to where we are.</div></aside></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-si-base-units.html#sec-si-base-units-3">in-context</a></span>
