<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Average and Instantaneous Velocity.</span></h1> <div class="para"> Technically, this formula gives us the <dfn class="terminology">average velocity</dfn>. The reason is that this calculation doesn’t take into account all of the nuances of what happens between the start and end of the motion. In the example, it’s probably the case that the car stopped somewhere along the way (at a stop sign or traffic light), and at that moment the car was not moving at 60 miles per hour. Simiarly, it’s likely that the car was driving faster than 60 mph on the freway. But because the elapsed time is so large, all of those details are lost and we are only left with the overall picture.</div> <div class="para"> Another way to think about the velocity is to try to keep track of all of those details. Rather than just thinking about the starting and stopping times and positions, we want to know what was happening at every moment of the trip. We would call that the <dfn class="terminology">instantaneous velocity</dfn>. It’s not hard to imagine creating a chart of values for velocity at specific times along the trip, similar to how we can create a chart of the position at any time. However, there’s an interesting question that arises from this. What do we even mean by "velocity at a specific time"? How would we measure it? Velocity requires movement, and movement requires time, so we will always need both a start time and a stop time for any measurement, and they can’t be the same. This brings us back to the arrow paradox! <a href="sec-graphing.html#par-arrow-paradox" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/par-arrow-paradox.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Paragraph">Paragraph </a>
</div> <div class="para">We will say more about this in a later section, but the if we practically want to try to get instantaneous velocity, we need to collect data in small enough increments that any change in velocity between the start and stop time is "small enough" to be ignored. So if we imagine two consecutive frames of a movie, we can think about how much the object moved over that period of time, and then use that with the framerate to get a good estimate of the instantaneous velocity.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-velocity.html#sec-velocity-5">in-context</a></span>
