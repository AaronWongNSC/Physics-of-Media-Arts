<div class="para">Imagine that you’re watching a sunset. What is the physical process that’s happening to allow you to experience it? The sun is generating photons, which are bouncing around all through the atmosphere and off of the ground, the clouds, the trees, and anything else that you see. Those photons then reach your eyes, which causes your brain to generate a picture that you interpret as watching the sunset.</div>
<div class="para">Now imagine that you want to take a picture of this sunset so that you can see it again at some point in the future. This will introduce (at least) two more steps into the process. The first thing you need to do is to try to capture the photons (you do this with your camera), and then you need to find a way to reproduce those photons using a medium of some sort (your cell phone, your computer monitor, or your printer). We are going to focus on digital images because it presents a distinct set of challenges from analog images.</div>
<div class="para">In this in-between layer, we create opportunities for errors to occur. Some of the errors are generated from things like an out-of-focus camera or corrupted data. But even if all of that were perfect, we still have a significant challenge. How do we capture reality and then reproduce it? The concept of color space is specifically focused on trying to figure out how to get colors as "correct" as possible.</div>
<div class="para"> The challenge is that cameras, like our eyes, are limited in the information they can capture. They aren’t capturing all of the information like a photospectrometer would. What is typically happening is that there is a sensor called a <dfn class="terminology">photosite</dfn> which converts photons into voltages, which are converted to digital information. And then that digital information will need to be re-translated back into colors generated by a monitor, which can only generate three distinct colors with different levels of intensity. So the broad spectrum of photons that you started with gets boiled down to essentially three specific wavelengths, which somehow needs to capture our experience of color.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-color-space.html#sec-color-space-4">in-context</a></span>
