<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Speed vs. Velocity.</span></h1> <div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Speed</dfn> is a number that measures of how fast something is moving. <dfn class="terminology">Velocity</dfn> is a vector that indicates how fast something is moving and in which direction. Under this framework, the magnitude of velocity is the speed, and speed is never a negative value. In common usage, speed and velocity are often interchangeable. However, from the definitions you can see that they are not interchangable in physics courses. So just be aware of the distinction and do your best to practice being precise in your language.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-velocity.html#sec-velocity-3">in-context</a></span>
