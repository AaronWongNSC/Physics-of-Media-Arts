<div class="para"> It might seem strange to say that you emit light, and that is because what we normally call "light" is electromagnetic radiation that our eyes can detect. However, in physics, we try to be more precise and call that "visible light" to avoid confusion. The reason for this is that the only difference between the radiation that our eyes can detect and the radiation that we need technology to detect is the amount of energy contained in that radiation. If we were to organize all of the types of electromagnetic radiation and order them by how much energy they each have, we would have a diagram known as the <dfn class="terminology">electromagnetic spectrum</dfn>. Below is a diagram that labels the different energy levels.</div>
