You might say you are in a particular classroom. Or perhaps you’re in your bedroom. Regardless of how you describe your position, it will always be relative to something else. Your classroom is a specific room inside of a specific building. You could avoid referencing a building by giving your GPS position, but that position is relative to the earth. There is no such thing as an "absolute" position. Position is always measured relative to something else.</div> <div class="para"> In mathematics, whenever we plot a point on the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> plane, we always start from a point that’s called the <dfn class="terminology">origin</dfn>. This is the point from which you originate your movement to locate the point. The same concept applies to physics. There will always be some position that is considered the origin for the particular problem, and that’s the point from which all other positions are measured.For example, if we are thinking about a runner in a straight-line race, we might have the starting line be the origin and then measure distances towards the finish line. If we are thinking about the motion of the planets, it might make sense for us to take the sun as the origin.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-position.html#sec-position-3">in-context</a></span>
