<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Average and Instantaneous Acceleration.</span></h1>
<div class="para"> Just as with velocity, the basic formula technically gives us <dfn class="terminology">average acceleration</dfn>. This is because you still have to have a time interval over which you’re measuring the change of velocity, and it’s possible for nuances of the changes in velocity to get lost in that. Just as before, we can construct the idea of the <dfn class="terminology">instantaneous acceleration</dfn> as the accelration at a specific moment in time, which runs into the same conundrum of there not being a single instant of time that is being observed. The basic resolution, as noted before, is to just take small enough time increments so that the change in velocity over that period of time is negligible.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-acceleration.html#sec-acceleration-4">in-context</a></span>
