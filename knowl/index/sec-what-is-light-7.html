<div class="para"> This mixed identity of light is often called <dfn class="terminology">wave-particle duality</dfn>, which is a catchy-but-imprecise name that tries to capture the idea that a wave is somehow both of these things, while also being neither one. There is some history behind this, which is why the term sticks around. It turns out that physicists debated about whether light was a wave or a particle, with different scientists proposing different experiments to try to prove it one way or the other. Eventually, it was discovered that both sides could be right, depending on how the experiment was set up.</div>
