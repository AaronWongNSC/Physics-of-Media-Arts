<div class="para"> The basic applications of trigonometry in physics are to determine the length of the side of a triangle and to determine an angle. The most common configuration that we see is that we know the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle and we know one of the angles, and our task is to determine the lengths of the two legs. In the context of vectors, this is often referred to as <dfn class="terminology">vector decomposition</dfn>.</div>
<div class="para">The following diagram is useful enough that it’s worth memorizing. The assumptions here are that you know the angle <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> and that the length of the hypotenuse is <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span> Then by using the formulas for sine and cosine, you can determine the lengths of the two legs. This triangle shows up in many different orientations, and so you won’t want to remember it in terms of the words "horizontal" and "vertical." That will lead to many errors. It is better to remember that the cosine function is adjacent to the angle and the sine function is opposite the angle.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-trigonometry.html#sec-trigonometry-6">in-context</a></span>
