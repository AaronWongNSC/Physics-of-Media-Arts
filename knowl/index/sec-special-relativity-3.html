<div class="para"> Albert Einstein is known for developing a theory of light known as <dfn class="terminology">the theory of special relativity</dfn>. Through a series of thought experiments, he deduced one of the most unusual quirks about light. Light always appears to be traveling the same speed, regardless of who is measuring it and the speed and direction they are going. Although the words that describe this phenomenon seem quite striaght-forward, the reality of this is utterly bizarre.</div>
