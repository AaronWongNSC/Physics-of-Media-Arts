<div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Linearly polarized light</dfn> vibrates back and forth in a flat line pattern. This can be visualized as light that needs to pass through a series of parallel bars. Only the light that is aligned with the bars can make it through, and the rest of it gets blocked. And this is basically what a polarizing filters do. Our eyes cannot detect polarlized light directly, but we can test whether light is polarized by rotating a polarizing filter. If the light is polarized, the brightness will change depending on the angle. In fact, if all of the light is polarized, you will block all of the light if you hold the filter perpendicular to the polarization.</div>
