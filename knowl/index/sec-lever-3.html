<div class="para logical">
<div class="para"> The lever consists of a solid beam and a pivot point (called the <dfn class="terminology">fulcrum</dfn>). Here is the formula for the mechanical advantage:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
MA = \frac{\text{distance from the fulcrum to the input force}}{\text{distance from the fulcrum to the output force}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">In other words, if the force is applied 2 meters from the fulcrum and the output force is 1 meter from the fulcrum, the lever creates a mechanical advantage of 2 (meaning that the output force is 2 times as large as the input force). Notice that if you think about the distances involved, the output force can only move half of the distance that the input force moves. This is an example of the tradeoff that you get with mechanical advantages.</div>
</div>
<div class="para"> The underlying physical mechanism for the lever is known as <dfn class="terminology">torque</dfn>. Torque is a twisting or rotational force and is the result of applying a force a distance from a pivot point. In simple cases, it is calculated as the product of the force and the distance from the pivot, which is known as the <dfn class="terminology">lever arm</dfn> (the distance from the pivot and the point where the force is applied).</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-lever.html#sec-lever-3">in-context</a></span>
