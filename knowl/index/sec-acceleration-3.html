<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Defining Acceleration.</span></h1> <div class="para"> The formula that defines <dfn class="terminology">acceleration</dfn> is <span class="process-math">\(a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\Delta v\)</span> is the change in the velocity and <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\)</span> is the change in time. This mirrors the formula that defines velocity. The units of acceleration take a little bit of getting used to. Since the units of velocity are <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Time}}\text{,}\)</span> the units of acceleration are <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\text{Length} / \text{Time}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Time}^2}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">It can be tempting to try to over-interpret these units. When you see it in the latter form, you might be tempted to try to understand what "squared seconds" are as a unit. But that unit is not a very sensible object to talk about because we don’t ever really multiply time by itself. The reason we write it in the latter form is because it’s more compact, but the "more correct" way to see it is the former way. It’s measuring how velocity (which happens to be measured in units of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Time}}\)</span>) changes over time.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-acceleration.html#sec-acceleration-3">in-context</a></span>
