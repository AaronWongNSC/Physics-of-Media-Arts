<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Parabolas.</span></h1> <div class="para">We need to spend a little bit of time talking about the graph of a parabola because it is fundamentally important to kinematics. We will use the graph of an object being launched vertically from the ground as our basic model for discussing the parabolaâ€™s central features.</div> <div class="para">The first observation of the parabola is the shape. Intuitively, it makes sense that if we launch something upward, it will eventually turn downward because of gravity. And the graph of the parabola matches this behavior. This shape is due to the negative sign on the <span class="process-math">\(t^2\)</span> term. If that term were positive, we would have an upward-opening parabola, and while this is perfectly meaningful mathematically, we do not have a lot of physics contexts where the parabola faces this way.</div> <div class="para"> The parabola has a point where the motion changes from going up to going down. That point is called the <dfn class="terminology">vertex</dfn> of the parabola. This point also marks the <dfn class="terminology">axis of symmetry</dfn> of the parabola, meaning that the shape of the parabola moving away from this point is the same in both directions. This means that if you were to watch an object in motion, you would not be able to tell whether time was going forward or backward based on the motion of the object alone. It looks exactly the same going up as it does going down with the time reversed.</div> <div class="para">If we were to drop an object from rest (without any initial velocity), we would get a half-parabola shape that starts from the vertex and falls down. The parabola from here has an interesting pattern. Suppose we picked a certain amount of time (such as 2 seconds) and measured how far it fell during that time. If we were to let it fall for twice the amount of time (4 seconds), it will have fallen four times the initial measurement. If we were to let it fall for three times the amount of time (6 seconds), it will have fallen nine times the initial measurement. This is the nature of the shape of a parabola.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-one-dim-const-acceleration.html#sec-one-dim-const-acceleration-4">in-context</a></span>
