<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Compound Levers.</span></h1>
<div class="para"> It is possible to get even greater multiplication of forces by using <dfn class="terminology">compound levers</dfn>. A compound lever is when a lever is being used against another lever.</div>
<div class="para">An example of a compound lever is a tortilla press. The top plate is on a hingle, which creates the first lever. The tortilla is between the hinge and the edge of the plate where the pressure will be placed, making it a second class lever. We can imagine that the tortilla dough is halfway between the hinge and the handle, resulting in a mechanical advantage of 2 (though people usually place it closer to the hinge, which makes sense from a mechanical advantage perspective). Then the handle is pressed down on the edge of the top plate, creating the second lever. This is also a second class lever because the hinge is on the outside of the plate. Typically, the place where the handle presses on the top plate is just a couple centimeters, but the handle is often 30 cm or more. This means that the mechanical advantage here is 15. But because this is being applied to a lever that also multiplies force, the total multiplication of force is 30.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-lever.html#sec-lever-5">in-context</a></span>
