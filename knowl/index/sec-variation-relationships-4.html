<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Inverse Variation.</span></h1> <div class="para"> Direct variations have the property that both variables increase or decrease together. <dfn class="terminology">Inverse variations</dfn> have the property that the two variables move in opposite directions. So as one variable increases, the other decreases. The common phrasing for this is "<span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is inversely proportional to <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span>" and is often written as <span class="process-math">\(A \propto \frac{1}{B}\text{.}\)</span> Here are a few examples:</div> <ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Speed is inversely proportional to the time traveled (for a constant distance): <span class="process-math">\(s \propto \frac{1}{t}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Current is inversely proportional to the resistance (with a constant voltage): <span class="process-math">\(I \propto \frac{1}{R}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass (with a constant force): <span class="process-math">\(a \propto \frac{1}{m}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
</ul> <div class="para">This phrasing can be used to loosely indicate that the two variables move in opposite directions from each other. For example, one might say something like "fun is inversely proportional to the amount of work that needs to be done" to mean that there’s more fun when there’s less work and that there’s less fun when there is more work. However, in the context of physics, it can only mean the precise mathematical relationship above.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-variation-relationships.html#sec-variation-relationships-4">in-context</a></span>
