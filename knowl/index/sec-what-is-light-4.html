<div class="para"> Light is <dfn class="terminology">electromagnetic radiation</dfn>. Before the term radiation scares you, it’s important to understand that everything in the universe that has a temperature above aboslute zero emits some form of electromagnetic radiation. The sun emits electromagnetic radiation, some of it that we can see and some of it we can’t, such as ultraviolet radiation, which causes sun burns and skin cancer. Cell phones emit electromagnetic radiation, which is how they communicate with each other. You emit electromagnetic radiation, which is how night vision goggles can see you. And all light bulbs, regardless of the type (incandescent, fluorescent, or LED) emit electromagnetic radiation.</div>
