<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Meters.</span></h1> <div class="para"> A <dfn class="terminology">meter</dfn> is a unit of distance, and it is the distance that light travels in <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{299792458}\)</span> of a second. It turns out that this is about 39 inches, or a few inches longer than a yard. But why would this be the definition? It turns out that one of the laws of physics is that the speed of light is the same for all observers. This claim takes a bit to unpack, because it’s a deeply unintuitive result that leads to all sorts of interesting consequences. So for now, we’ll just say that the speed of light is a universal constant, which makes it a useful value for making measurements. The specific denominator of the fraction comes the speed of light being exactly 299,792,458 meters per second. And this also presents a chicken-and-egg problem. We use the speed of light to define a distance, but then we can’t make sense of that distance that without measuring the speed of light.</div> <div class="para">Humans have been measuring distance for much longer than we have known the speed of light. And there were multiple iterations of the distance of a meter, but each of those were found to be imprecise. For example, an early definition of a meter was connected to the length of a particular pendulum to make it oscillate with a specific frequency, but that length turned out to be different in different locations (due to the fact that gravity changes with altitude). Another attempted meter was to define it to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator, but that measurement assumes the earth is smooth enough to make that meaningful. And while neither of those two methods were perfect, they did create an expectation for what a meter ought to be. And so the choice of declaring that the speed of light is exactly 299,792,458 meters per second was to create an integer value that also wouldn’t significantly alter the existing meter.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-si-base-units.html#sec-si-base-units-4">in-context</a></span>
