<div class="para"> There are two main ways to think about what light is. The first is that light is a <dfn class="terminology">photon</dfn>, or a packet of energy. In this perspective, light is a particle. That means that it has a specific location that is traveling in a specific direction at a certain speed. In this framework, the energy of a photon is an intrinsic property that defines what type of light it is. Alternatively, we can think of light as a <dfn class="terminology">wave</dfn>. In this perspective, we think of light traveling through the universe the way that a wave travels across water. The wave does not have a specific location, but is kind of spread out over a region. The wave may be moving in a specific direction and speed, but it’s less clear what, exactly, is the thing that’s moving.</div>
