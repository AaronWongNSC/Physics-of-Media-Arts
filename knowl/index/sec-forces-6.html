<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Surface Friction.</span></h1> <div class="para"> Friction is the force that resists the relative movement of objects sliding against each other. Friction can occur between many types of objects: solid objects against other solid objects, solid objects against a fluid (such as air or water resistance), and a fluid against itself are just some of the ways friction can be manifested.</div> <div class="para"> We are going to focus our attention on the friction between solid objects, which is known as <dfn class="terminology">surface friction</dfn>. But even this isn’t quite an entirely simple concept, because there are two types of friction. There’s <dfn class="terminology">static friction</dfn>, which is the friction between two objects when there is no movement between them, and then there’s <dfn class="terminology">kinetic friction</dfn>, which is the friction between two objects when they are moving relative to each other.</div> <div class="para"> The formula for the force of friction between two objects at rest relative to each other is <span class="process-math">\(F \leq \mu_s N\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is the magnitude of the normal force and <span class="process-math">\(\mu_s\)</span> is the <dfn class="terminology">coefficient of static friction</dfn>, whose value depends on the two surfaces that are in contact with each other. The direction of the friction force is always opposite of the direction that resists movement. Smaller values of <span class="process-math">\(\mu_s\)</span> mean that there is less friction, with 0 being no friction at all. The reason that the force is given as an inequality is that the quantity on the right represents the maximum amount of friction that can exist between the two surfaces.</div> <div class="para"> The <dfn class="terminology">coefficient of kinetic friction</dfn> (denoted <span class="process-math">\(\mu_k\)</span>) plays the same role as the coefficient of static friction, except it applies when the two objects are sliding past each other. The coefficient of kinetic friction is always smaller than the coefficient of static friction for the same pair of objects. You have experienced this if you have ever tried to move something heavy. It takes a certain amount of effort to get it moving, and once it’s moving it takes less effort to keep it moving. In this case, the formula is <span class="process-math">\(F = \mu_k N\text{,}\)</span> and this is an equality because in this situation the friction is always at its maximal value. If the movement of the object slows down to the point that it is no longer moving, then we would be back in the case of static friction.</div> <details class="example example-like born-hidden-knowl"><summary class="knowl__link"><h2 class="heading">
<span class="type">Example</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">6.4.0.1</span><span class="period">.</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="title">Inclined Plane with Friction.</span>
</h2></summary><article class="example example-like knowl__content"> <div class="para">We are going to consider an object at rest on an inclined plane at the angle <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{.}\)</span> We want to understand how friction fits into this picture as we slowly increase the slope, but not so steep that the object begins sliding.</div> <div class="para">If we look at the free body diagram for this situation, we will see that there are three forces. Gravity (<span class="process-math">\(F_\text{g}\)</span>) is pulling the object downward into the inclined plane, the inclined plane exerts a normal force (<span class="process-math">\(F_\text{N}\)</span>), and the static friction (<span class="process-math">\(F_{\text{fr}}\)</span>) points parallel to the incline in the upward direction (opposite the direction the block would slide without friction). Our task is to determine the magnitudes of all of these forces. Since nothing is changing its movement, the net force is zero.</div> <div class="para">We know the formula for the gravitational force (<span class="process-math">\(F_\text{g} = mg\)</span>) and the force of friction (<span class="process-math">\(F_\text{fr} = \mu_s F_\text{N}\text{,}\)</span> but we don’t know the the normal force. All we know is that this force must balance out gravity and friction in order to keep the object stationary. We will decompose all of the vectors into a part that is parallel to the surface and a part that is perpendicular to the surface. (We could have done vertical and horizontal components, but the equations end up being a little bit messier.) Using trigonometry, we can get the following equations:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
mg \cos \theta \amp = F_\text{N}\\
mg \sin \theta \amp = \mu_s \cdot F_\text{N}
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">The first equation gives us the normal force, and we can plug this into the second equation to solve for the coefficient of friction.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
mg \sin \theta \amp = \mu_s \cdot F_\text{N}  \\
mg \sin \theta \amp = \mu_s \cdot mg \cos(\theta)  \\
\mu_s \amp = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \tan(\theta) 
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">What this is telling us is that the coefficient of friction is equal to the tangent of the angle of the incline, at least as long as nothing is moving. But if the angle is steep enough, the value of <span class="process-math">\(\tan(\theta)\)</span> will exceed the maximum value of <span class="process-math">\(\mu_s\)</span> and the forces will no longer be in balance. In particular, the friction force will change from static friction to a kinetic friction (causing it to get smaller), and the forces in the direction parallel to the plane will no longer be in balance. There will be more force pointing down the slope than pointing up, which means that the object will begin sliding downward.</div></article></details></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-forces.html#sec-forces-6">in-context</a></span>
