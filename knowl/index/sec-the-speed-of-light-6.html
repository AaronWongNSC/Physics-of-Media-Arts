<div class="para"> The next estimate for the speed of light was also derived from looking at the sky. There is a visual artifact called <dfn class="terminology">stellar aberration</dfn> which makes the positions of stars shift slightly due to the movement of the earth around the sun. This can be understood by imagining a ball falling straight down from the sky. If you’re standing still, you will see that the ball is falling vertically. But if you are walking towards the ball as it’s falling, it will appear to be falling at an angle towards you. The English astronomer James Bradley was monitoring the position of a star called Eltanin and noticed that it moved in a way that the current theories did not correctly predict. Bradley theorized the concept of stellar aberration to explain this, and used it to estimate the speed of light to be approximately <span class="process-math">\(3.1 \times 10^8\)</span> meters per second.</div>
