<div class="para"> The formulas that describe all of this have an interesting property, which is that it is impossible to accelerate an object with mass to reach the speed of light. We’re going to return to the pellet gun example, except that we’re going to have a very powerful gun and a very powerful car. Let’s suppose that the car is moving at half of the speed of light, and that the gun shoots at half of the speed of light. If we were to use classical velocity addition, we would say that the pellet must be moving at the speed of light. But this is impossible! It turns out that <dfn class="terminology">relativistic velocity addition</dfn> is more complicated than that, and it results in a speed that is slower than classical velocity addition.</div>
