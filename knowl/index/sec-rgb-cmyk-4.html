<div class="para">CMYK is the color scheme whose primary colors are cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. This is also built around human biology, but moving in the opposite direction as RGB. Instead of starting with black and turning up the colors, this starts with white and removes colors. This is used for pigment-based colors, like paint and ink, where the illumination source is external and the colors that are seen are only from reflected light.</div>
<div class="para"> The reason a white piece of paper looks white is because it’s reflecting red, green, and blue photons back at us. If we add red ink to the paper, the reason that we see red is because the ink is absorbing the green and blue photons, and is only reflecting back the red ones. And this is what is meant by <dfn class="terminology">subtractive color</dfn>. However, when it comes to pigments, thinking in terms of red, green, and blue turns out to be more complicated when you mix them. The underlying reason for this is that generating red means absorbing green and blue, and it makes more sense to have the primary colors absorb single colors rather than pairs of colors.</div>
<div class="para">And this is where we get the cyan, magenta, and yellow base colors. Cyan is the color you get when you absorb only red light. Magenta comes from absorbing green. Yellow is the result of absorbing blue. Then you can mix two of these colors together to get the secondary colors of red, green, and blue. For example, red is a mixture of magenta (which absorbs green) and yellow (which absorbs blue).</div>
<div class="para">The role of black in this system is because there’s a gap between theory and practice. In theory, if you mix cyan, magenta, and yellow together, you should get black. However, in practice, the pigments are not perfect. That is, cyan doesn’t absorb all of the blue, and so on. This means that mixing the colors together usually results in a brown color. So adding black as a separate color sidesteps the challenge of needing to make perfect cyan, magenta, and yellow colors in order to mix them together to get black.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-rgb-cmyk.html#sec-rgb-cmyk-4">in-context</a></span>
