<div class="para"> The language of physics includes a number of important mathematical objects. Vectors are among the most central type of mathematical object because it is used to represent everything from forces to positions to electric fields. A <dfn class="terminology">vector</dfn> is a mathematical quantity that includes information about both a direction and a magnitude (or length). This section is just a brief, minimally mathematical introduction to the topic. Itâ€™s not uncommon for people studying physics to take an entire course to help them understand what vectors are and how to do calculations with them. We are not going to need much more than the basic ideas and a minimal amount of vector algebra.</div>
