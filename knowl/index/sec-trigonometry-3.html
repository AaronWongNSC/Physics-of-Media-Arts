<div class="para"> We will start with a simple right triangle. The longest side of a right triangle is known as the <dfn class="terminology">hypotenuse</dfn> and the other two sides are called <dfn class="terminology">legs</dfn>. The Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs. But thatâ€™s not typically how people remember it. If we were to label the lengths of the legs as <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and the length of the hypotenuse as <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> then we would have the relationship <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{,}\)</span> which is the way most people remember it.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-trigonometry.html#sec-trigonometry-3">in-context</a></span>
