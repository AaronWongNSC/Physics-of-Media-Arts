  "body": " The Scientific Method(s)     The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind.   Thomas Henry Huxley     If you search around the internet for explanations of the scientific method, you'll find that there isn't an agreement on the steps. Here are a few examples:     Khan Academy's Introduction to Biology : (1) Make an observation; (2) Ask a question; (3) Form a hypothesis; (4) Make a prediction; (5) Test the prediction; (6) Iterate     University of Nevada Reno Extension's Fact Sheet on the Scientific Method : (1) Make an observation; (2) Define the problem; (3) Form a hypothesis; (4) Conduct the experiment; (5) Derive a theory     Your Dictionary's Article on the Scientific Method : (1) Define purpose; (2) Construct hypothesis; (3) Test hypothesis and collect data; (4) Analyze data; (5) Draw conclusion; (6) Communicate results    There are more examples in an article found in the CBE Life Sciences Education journal that explores the topic much more deeply and in the context of K-12 science education standards in Kansas from 2005.  So what's really happening here? Most science textbooks start off by teaching students the scientific method, as if there is one precise way to do science. One of the main reasons for this is to try to establish the concept of scientific rigor. By trying to put everything into a simple box, it is possible to portray science as the ultimate way to pursue what is true. Unfortunately, this representation is wrong from both a historical perspective and from a practical perspective. It is probably most correct to say that there are many scientific methods, and that those methods vary from one field of study to the next. How you might try to study physics is different from how you might try to study biology.  That said, it's not as if the ideas behind \"the\" scientific method are completely wrong. There is still value to having a general framework as a guidepost, even if it's not completely general or completely accurate in every context.  In this book, we are interested in trying to make the study of physics both practical and conceptual, but without getting too bogged down in unnecessary details. And trying to provide a precise formulation of the scientific is one of those unnecessary details. Instead, we will opt for a much more informal presentation of what the scientific method is.   scientific method (informal)  informal scientific method  An Informal Scientific Method   The scientific method is a two-step process of making observations and formulating ideas based on those observations. In many cases, the ideas that are formulated lead to the creation of experiments in order to generate additional observations that can be used to refine those ideas.    This two-step understanding of the scientific method is probably the simplest way to think about the process of doing science. If we go back to the examples of the scientific method found on the internet, we can see that the two steps of making observations and formulating ideas are well-represented. Throughout this book, we will be referring back to these two steps as part of how we try to advance our knowledge of physics.  More importantly, this framework helps to establish something that Thomas Huxley (the person quoted at the start of the section) was getting at with his ideas. Here's a longer quote from his essay \"On Our Knowledge of the Causes of the Phenomena of Organic Nature\":   The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind. It is simply the mode at which all phenomena are reasoned about, rendered precise and exact. There is no more difference, but there is just the same kind of difference, between the mental operations of a man of science and those of an ordinary person, as there is between the operations and methods of a baker or of a butcher weighing out his goods in common scales, and the operations of a chemist in performing a difficult and complex analysis by means of his balance and finely-graduated weights. It is not that the action of the scales in the one case, and the balance in the other, differ in the principles of their construction or manner of working; but the beam of one is set on an infinitely finer axis than the other, and of course turns by the addition of a much smaller weight.  You will understand this better, perhaps, if I give you some familiar example. You have all heard it repeated, I dare say, that men of science work by means of induction and deduction, and that by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of sense, wring from Nature certain other things, which are called natural laws, and causes, and that out of these, by some cunning skill of their own, they build up hypotheses and theories. And it is imagined by many, that the operations of the common mind can be by no means compared with these processes, and that they have to be acquired by a sort of special apprenticeship to the craft. To hear all these large words, you would think that the mind of a man of science must be constituted differently from that of his fellow men; but if you will not be frightened by terms, you will discover that you are quite wrong, and that all these terrible apparatus are being used by yourselves every day and every hour of your lives.   In other words, the idea he's putting forward is that scientific thinking is just regular thinking, but more refined. There is no \"magic\" in the scientific method that is reserved only for scientists doing real science. It's just a way of learning that is very similar to how people all over the world learn things. We pay attention to what's going on around us, we have ideas for what's happening, and then we see how those ideas play out in reality, and we allow that reality to refine our thinking a little bit more.

  "title": "Hypothesis, Theory, Law, and Models",
  "body": " Hypothesis, Theory, Law, and Models     In this house, we obey the laws of thermodynamics!   Homer Simpson     Another area of scientific thinking where it's possible to try to get unnecessarily rigorous is the distinction between hypotheses, theories, and laws. There is no underlying rule that allows us to classify each of these into neat groupings, and even the language itself is inconsistent. So this conversation ends up being more less accurate the more that we try to make it rigorous.  Typically, the word \"hypothesis\" is reserved for ideas we have that we are testing. For example, if we make a prediction about what is going to happen in a physics lab, we would typically call that idea a hypothesis. The whole point of making hypotheses is that it forces us to put our ideas into words that can be meaningfully tested for accuracy. After we make further observations (such as by running an experiment), we can then go back to those words and determine whether they were right or wrong (or at least mostly right or mostly wrong), and that leads us into the act of refining our ideas.  The words \"theory\" and \"law\" are actually much less precise. Some might try to talk about these as two different levels of knowledge and testability, where a \"theory\" is an idea that has been well-tested, but a \"law\" is so well-tested that we just don't ever expect it to be violated. However, this just isn't the case in physics.  For example, there's something known as \"Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation\" that is a formula that we can use to calculate the force of gravity between any two objects. The problem with this \"law\" is that it's not actually a law. The reason is that the law isn't perfectly correct. There are many observations we can make that would violate this law, such as looking at the orbits of planets around the sun. (If you measure things accurately enough, you would discover that the predictions are close, but not quite correct.)  There's also \"Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity\" which (among other things) establishes the idea that nothing can move faster than the speed of light. Up to this point, there are no known violations of this. And so it would seem we should call this a \"law\" instead of a theory. But the language around this is so deeply rooted in history that it's a change that will never happen.   model Ultimately, a better word for these is to call them \"models.\" A model is just a particular representation of a scientific idea. A model makes no declarations about what is \"true\" about the universe. It simply says that under a certain set of assumptions, we would expect the universe to behave in a certain way. Whether or not that happens in reality is an entirely different question. In physics, it's very common to be working in the framework of models instead of debating between theories and laws.  For example, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation gives us a formula for how much force we expect there to be between two massive objects, and it is known to be accurate when the masses aren't too large. But when the objects get larger, we may have to turn to Einstein's Theory of General Relativity to make better predictions.  Our approach to physics will be built around creating models for various situations. Those models will give us a theoretical foundation with which to analyze what might happen, and we will discuss things that can happen that will cause those models to fail.

  "body": " Physics Labs     The difference between screwing around and science is writing it down.   Adam Savage (Mythbusters)     Physics labs are simply a formal structure that give us opportunities to practice making observations and formulating ideas. In this book, we set them up in a very formal way because it's the best way to really slow down the process and allow deeper insights to settle in.  Your lab report should be understood as a completely self-contained document that describes what happened in the lab and what you learned from it. You should not assume that the person reading your lab report has access to the textbook or the lab procedures. All of that information must be included in your report. If the lab procedure has reflection questions, you should copy those questions into the appropriate section, and not just write down a number and your answers.  A carefully written lab report is much more than just presenting experimental data. It's a reflection of your ability to communicate the ideas that you have been asked to consider. It's also important to understand that not all labs work out perfectly, and sometimes you get results that are different than what is expected. Part of your job as a scientific thinker is to try to understand and explain discrepancies between the anticipated results and the actual results. In many cases, there is more to learn when something goes wrong compared to when everything goes right.  The following outline should be used for all lab activities:    Title and Header  This section is mostly for organization purposes. You should use the title that is stated in the lab procedures, but if you want to come up with a clever subtitle, you may certainly add one in. The remainder of the header information is the name of the group members. Typically, lab groups will be limited to three members, but your instructor may decide differently.    Introduction  This is where you state the overall objectives of the experiment. You will also want to include a discussion of the relevant concepts associated with the objectives. In a sense, you should think about this as the section that teaches the reader everything they need to know in order to understand the experiment you are about to run.    Equipment List  If the lab requires the use of specific pieces of equipment, these will be listed in this section to help with organization and preparation. This section is sometimes omitted if the lab doesn't need anything (other than perhaps some paper and a writing implement).    Procedure  This is where you explain the step-by-step procedure that you were meant to follow, and indications of any times that you deviated from that. This part should be detailed enough that someone else can follow the instructions to attempt to replicate your experiment. Your steps should be numbered, but your explanations of what happened should be written as paragraphs.    Results and Data  This section is where you record what happened. Typically, while you're actually running the experiment you'll be keeping your data recorded in a lab notebook or on other paper. When it comes to putting that data into a lab report, you are not simply copying over that information, but you are organizing it so that it is as legible and understandable as possible. This may mean that you put the data into tables and a graph, or maybe it's just a written description of observations at different times. This section also includes relevant calculations. This does not mean that you should include all of your scratch work. It should contain just the relevant calculations and a minimal amount of information or explanation (if needed) for what those calculations represent. It should not be a solid wall of formulas.    Discussion  This is where the heart of the report lives. All of the other work that you've done leads up to this section. Here is where you will respond to the questions that are contained in the lab. Your goal is to demonstrate that you've learned something from the observations you made while executing the lab. These questions should all revolve around the objectives that you presented in the introduction. When possible, you should make direct reference to the objectives for emphasis. In many cases, this may also include an error analysis, where you talk about the things that went wrong and how those things might be addressed if you were to do the experiment again.    Conclusion  Write a paragraph or two that summarizes the lab and what you learned from it.

  "body": " Becoming a Curious Thinker   Introduction  How well do you understand the world around you? The first lab activity is designed to cultivate a mind that is curious and willing to ask questions, even if they seem mundane. Because it turns out that the world is a fascinating place if you're willing to explore it.  We are going to visit a few different locations and engage in the practice of asking deep questions and trying to think about how we might get answers to those questions. In some situations, the answer might be to just search the internet for an explanation. But try to push beyond internet searches and think about how you might try to answer the question in other ways. Try to be clever and unorthodox, if you can.  Note that some questions will be dependent upon the specific context, and a general answer won't be good enough. In those cases, maybe the way to get an answer is to gather samples or data, and then maybe conduct some type of experiment. In some cases, you might not even know what types of experiments you could run to answer the question, in which case you might want to do a little background research on the internet to see if there are any easy answers. Ultimately, this activity is not about actually doing the research to get the answers, just the practice of asking the questions and taking the first steps towards starting the research.    Procedure  We are going to explore the following locations: the classroom, the building, the world outside of the building, and your home. At each location, we're going to complete the following steps:    Identify 5-7 objects in the space.    Pick 1 object to ask questions about.    Write down a list of at least 5 questions about it. (Feel free to ask more!)    Pick 3 of those questions and determine how you might go about finding the answer to those questions.      Bedroom Example    Location: Bedroom    Objects of Interest: Light switch, mattress, dresser, lamp, sheets, carpet, T-shirt    Questions about the light switch:    How does it work?    How much electricity flows through it?    What is it made of?    How is it manufactured?    Are there other types of light switches? What makes them different?    How easy is it to fix or repair a broken light switch?      Finding answers:    How does it work? -- There's probably a YouTube video that explains this. We could also try to take it apart and see if we can see the mechanism.    How much electricity flows through it? -- We would need a device that can be used to measure the amount of electricity. A quick internet search shows that such a device is called a \"multimeter\".    What is it made of? -- The outside appears to be a type of plastic, and there might be a kit that can be used to determine the type of plastic it is. But the inside part probably has some metal in it because electricity doesn't flow through plastic. We might have to use a different type of kit to test for different types of metals.        Parking Lot Example    Location: Parking Lot    Objects of Interest: Cars, trees, birds, dumpster, painted stripes    Questions about the cars:    How many cars are in the parking lot?    How many cars are normally in the parking lot?    How many cars does the parking lot hold?    What is the most common type of car in the parking lot?    How much does a car weigh?    How many cars are hybrid or electric?    How many of the cars are not locked?      Finding Answers:    How many cars are in the parking lot? -- We can try to count them, but cars might come and go while we're doing that. So maybe it's better to take a pictures of the parking lot and count from the photos. Having a drone might be useful because then we could take an overhead view of the parking lot.    How many cars are normally in the parking lot? -- We could count the number of cars at different times and then create a graph of the results. Or we can have someone monitor the entrances and exits to see when cars come and go and use that information to count the cars throughout the day.    How many of the cars are not locked? -- We could go through the parking lot and try to open the car doors and see how many of them open. [Note: Do NOT do this! We're just speculating on ways we can find the answer.] We can also observe people as they walk to the car to see how many of them need to unlock the car before getting in. We would have to be close enough to hear the car locks in case someone has keyless car entry.        Discussion  After you've completed the tasks, answer the following discussion questions:    Which location was it easiest to identify objects to ask questions about? And which location was it the most difficult? Why do you think that was the case?    What object was easiest to ask questions about? Were there any objects that you intentionally didn't pick because you thought it would be hard to come up with questions about it?    What was the most clever way you came up with for answering one of your questions? What did you think was clever about it?    Are there any questions that you actually want to know the answer to? If so, which ones? And why do you want to know?      Conclusion  As you went through the exercise, you should have found that some questions have answers that seem to be easily accessible, while others were complicated enough that you really need a lot of information to even begin the process of answering the question. The world we live in is extremely complex, and we take a lot of it for granted. And all it takes is a curious mind to begin to peel back the layers.    Lab Write-Up Guidance  Use the following outline to help you write up your lab report completely and correctly.    Title and Header  What is the title of the lab and who was in the lab group?    Introduction  In your own words, what was the purpose of the lab activity? This should only take a few sentences for this lab.    Procedure  This lab has you executing the same procedure in a few different locations. You do not need to write out the procedure multiple times. Find a nice way of organizing it so it's clear what you were expected to do.    Results and Data  For this lab, the results and data consist of lists and sentences. You can use the examples in the lab activity to give you some ideas for how to organize your work.    Discussion  Answer the discussion questions. Be sure that you state the original question and organize it in a way that is easy to follow.    Conclusion  Write a few sentences explaining your experience with the lab. Did you have any particularly clever thoughts, questions, or insights as you worked through the different settings?

  "title": "Calculators",
  "body": " Calculators     Calculators can only calculate - they cannot do mathematics.   John A. Van de Walle   One of the most basic tools of physics is the calculator. While it is certainly possible to do most of the calculations by hand, there's not a lot of value to that in the context of this course. But with that said, it puts an additional layer of importance for using your calculator correctly.  One of the challenges of this section is that there are many different types of calculators out there, and they don't all have the same set of features. In fact, not all calculators behave the same way, and it's possible for two calculators to give different results for the same button presses. Rather than going into the details of different brands, we're going to take a high level overview of calculators and develop some basic strategies for how to avoid errors, regardless of how your specific calculator works.    Order of Operations  One of the main errors (aside from pressing the wrong button) that can arise is when the desired calculation and the calculation that the calculator understands are not in alignment with each other. These are some of the most difficult errors to identify on the fly because your only indication that something went wrong is that the number is wrong. In some situations, the number you get is \"obviously\" wrong (such as getting a negative number when you know you should be getting a positive number). But the most common result is that a student dutifully copies the number the calculator gives them onto their paper, then moves forward from there without the slightest bit of hesitation.   order of operations Underneath this problem is an understanding of the order of operations . When used in the mathematical context, this is interpreted as PEMDAS (Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally) or BOMDAS, which is understood to be a set of rules for how to interpret a mathematical expression. More broadly, however, it just means the order in which you do things. For example, socks-before-shoes is an order of operations. The reason we need to think about this broader sense is because not all calculators understand the mathematical order of operations the way that it's set up in mathematics.  Consider the calculation . You would probably immediately recognize that you need to do the multiplication before the addition, and get the mathematically correct result of 7. But in order for you to know that, you had to see the whole problem before you strated. You had to know that the multiplication was at the end, and you used that information to determine how you were going to do the computation. Some calculators have this ability, but others do not.   immediate execution (calculator) Some calculators use the immediate execution method of computation. This means that it tries to do the calculation as you type it in. And even within this category, there are calculators that can hold values in memory and those that can't. Let's analyze how one of these calculators might see this calculation.     : The calculator understands that you're starting to type in a number. As long as you keep typing in digits, it will keep thinking that you're still typing in the number.     : You've now pressed a mathematical operation, so it knows that you're done with the first number. The next thing it is expecting is another number.     : Just as with the first step, as long as you're typing in numbers, it's waiting for you to finish telling it the number.     : At this point, things can go in one of two ways. Some calculators will understand that you're done with the second number of the sum and do that calculation right away. Then it will use that result with the multiplication that you're about to give it. On the other hand, some calculators know about the mathematical order of operations, and it will know that it needs to do this multiplication first, then go back and add the other result. But in order to do that, it will also need to hold that original 1 in memory.    While there is more to the calculation, this is the critical step where things can fall apart. And this is why it's critical for you to know how your calculator works. Lots of students get problems wrong because of something as simple as this.   infix notation (calculator) It's worth noting that there are some calculators that take the whole expression in before doing the calculation. These are sometimes called infix notation calculators. These behave more like how you would behave when looking at a calculation. You would use a logical system to determine which calculation needs to be performed first based on the order of operations, and then you would simplify from there. But infix notation also has order of operations pitfalls.  Consider the calculation . You can easily see that this is equal to 1. But if you don't type it into the calculator correctly, it won't give you the desired result. Here is the button sequences that students would typically press: . And some students might even see in the display and feel as though everything is correct. But how would the calculator see it?  The calculator is programmed to try to follow the order of operations, and so it will scan through the different operations to help it determine the order in which it will do the calculations. Based on this, it will see the division symbol and prioritize that one. This would lead to the first calculation being . This will be added to 3, giving 5.5 as the result.  The problem is now clear. You need to tell the calculator that the is all in the denominator for the division calculation. The way to do this is to use parentheses (which most infix calculators have). Once you type it as , it will give you the correct result.    A Basic Calculator Strategy  One of the best calculator strategies to develop is to get in the habit of only doing a few calculations at a time. As the expressions being evaluated become increasingly complex, the chances of making a mistake increase significantly. These errors can be as simple as pressing the wrong button (or failing to press a button) while typing in the calculation to errors related to the discussion above. As mentioned before, these are the types of errors that can be difficult to identify because you can hit the equal key and never realize that there was an error.  The technique is to use the order of operations to scan the expression for groups of calculations that can be executed together. In physics courses, this often reduces to one of two strategies: (1) Calculating the numerator and denominator of a fraction separately before taking the quotient; (2) Calculating all of the products before adding them together.  When you do this, you will need to write down the intermediate results. This is because you will need to reference the results you get in future calculations. This also provides you an opportunity to check your work by checking that you get a consistent result on the shorter calculations. It is generally good to keep at least 4 decimals in the middle of the calculation in order to avoid rounding errors. This is especially true for division calculations, where errors can quickly become magnified (typically when dividing by a small value).

  "body": " Scientific Notation     We are very very small. But we are profoundly capable of very very big things.   Stephen Hawking   Scientific notation is a way of representing numbers that are very large or very small in a way that helps us to work with and interpret the numbers much more easily. This is best exhibited by an example. Which number is larger: 705745422424033592 or 70574542424033591? As you try to compare the digits, you can start to see the difficulty of working with very large numbers in this form. If you were clever, you might have tried to count the number of digits in each number, and that's the basic insight of scientific notation.   scientific notation  standard notation  coefficient (scientific notation)  exponent (scientific notation) A number is in scientific notation if it is of the form , where and is an integer. We call the coefficient and the exponent . In contrast to scientific notation is standard notation , which is simply writing numbers the way we normally do.  A quick way to interpret a number in scientific notation is to look at the exponent. Numbers with positive exponents are typically \"big\" numbers and numbers with negative exponents are typically \"small\" numbers. The words \"big\" and \"small\" in quotes because we need to keep in mind that some of the work of the \"size\" consideration is being done by the units, and there's no absolute scale that we can use.   Standard Notation and Scientific Notation      Converting To and From Scientific Notation  The conversion to and from scientific notation follows from the fact that multiplying and dividing by 10 simply moves the decimal point to the left or to the right. However, we will want to avoid using the division symbol, so we will write division using negative exponents.   Multiplying and Dividing by 10    When converting a number from scientific notation to standard notation, the size of the exponent tells you how many places to move the decimal and the sign (positive or negative) of the exponent tells you which direction you need to move the decimal point. Positive exponents move the decimal to the right (it makes the number bigger) and negative exponents move the decimal to the left (it makes the number smaller). When you do this, you may need to insert zeros between the decimal point and the digits you started with as placeholders. We're using the fact that exponents represent repeated multiplication, so that (for example) multiplying by means multiplying by 10 three times, which would move the decimal three spaces to the right (one for each multiplication by 10).   From Scientific Notation to Standard Notation    When converting a number from standard notation to scientific notation, we will follow a mechanical process. To get the coefficient, think of the given number as string of digits without a decimal point, and put the decimal point to the right of the leading digit (the left-most non-zero digit) and drop all the unnecessary zeros. Then to determine the exponent, think about where the decimal point you created would need to go to get back the original number, and use the corresponding value.   From Standard Notation to Scientific Notation  Converting 1234000 to scientific notation:    Place the decimal to the right of the leading digit and drop the unnecessary zeros: 1.234    Determine how the decimal must move to restore the original number: 1.234 1234000 requires moving the decimal point 6 places to the right.    Write the number with the corresponding exponent:     Converting 0.000056789 to scientific notation:    Place the decimal to the right of the leading digit and drop the unnecessary zeros: 5.6789    Determine how the decimal must move to restore the original number: 5.6789 0.000056789 requires moving the decimal point 5 places to the left.    Write the number with the corresponding exponent:        Working with Exponents   exponents To work with scientific notation, you need to understand a few basic concepts about exponents . The first is that an exponent represents repeated multiplication. For example, . The second is that negative exponents represent a reciprocal, so that . Also notice that this works when the negative exponent is in the denominator, so that . Lastly, when you have a fraction involving exponents on the top and bottom of the fraction, you can cancel out pairs of terms (one on top and one on bottom).  There are some formulas that you can use for this, but the formulas tend to obscure the ideas, rather than adding clarity. So you will need to go out on the internet if you want to find and use the formulas. The examples will show you the logic, and if you understand the logic then you won't need the formulas.   Exponent Practice  Calculate .   Calculate .   Calculate .   Calculate .      Products and Quotients with Scientific Notation  Some calculators are capable of handling scientific notation. You would want to look for a button that has an EE or EXP on it, and you would want to find a tutorial (or experiment with the calculator) to make sure that you understand how to use it properly. But while you could use such a calculator to do your calculations, it is still important to understand the basic algebra that goes on behind it.  The key idea that we use is that when we have products and quotients (but not sums and differences), we can do the arithmetic in any order we want and still get the same answer. (Technically the last fact is a combination of two algebraic properties known as the commutative property and the associative property of multiplication.) The procedure we will follow is to multiply and\/or divide all of the coefficients and all of the exponent terms separately, and then combine the results in the end.   significant figures This is a good time to raise a point about significant figures. A system of significant figures represents a method for tracking the level of meaningful accuracy of the digits in a calculation. One of the great challenges in empirical work is that measurements are inherently imprecise. (We'll talk a little more about this in a later section.) If your digital scale might read 13 grams, but you won't really know whether the weight is closer to 12.6 grams or 13.4 grams. And so the 13 grams is actually just an estimate. When multiple values in a calculation are estimates, it can often be useful to keep track of the level of the estimate, and this is done through significant figures.  The general idea is that you can track significant figures in scientific notation by counting the number of decimal points there are in the representations and doing some bookkeeping with those values. For our purposes, we're going to skip this and just generally aim to keep at least 4 decimals. Although there are some useful ideas that can be developed in terms of really thinking through the concept of computational errors, it's a little bit off target for the big picture goals that we're looking for.

  "title": "Graphing Data",
  "body": " Graphing Data     -----   ----     Representing Two-Dimensional Data  Much of physics is about understanding the relationship between different variables. One of the ways we can identify such relationships is by graphing. While graphs may not be as precise as formulas, it gives us a language that we can use to try to understand certain types of relationships intuitively. We will specifically be focusing on the relationship between two variables, though many of these ideas can be extended to more variables.    Graphing Basics  A graph consists of points, lines, and curves plotted in a two-dimensional grid. Each direction represents a different variable. Points are named using the convention of an ordered pair , where the horizontal variable is listed first, followed by the vertical variable. Although the variables and were used in this example, we are not limited to that choice of variable. In many cases, we will have time on the horizontal axis, which is usually denoted with the variable .  There are two types of data that we will be working with: discrete and continuous. Discrete data means that we are picking specific values of the variables to plot. For example, we might be measuring the position of an object after 0 seconds, 1 second, 2 seconds, and 3 seconds. This leaves a gap of time where we don't have data. For example, we would have to guess the position of the object at 1.5 seconds. Continuous data means that the data does not have those gaps. Technically, any time we gather data we will have discrete data, but there are certainly situations where the data points are close enough that we treat the data as being practically continuous.   arrow paradox The challenge of continuous data has been explored from at least the time of the ancient Greeks. There is a thought experiment known as the Arrow Paradox that highlights the challenge of this. But we can think of this in terms of using a camera to film a moving object. Each frame of video captures a specific moment in time. But in each frame, the object is frozen in place. This means that in that moment, it doesn't make sense to say that the object is moving because it has specific location at that time. If we have a faster camera, we can capture more moments of time in the movement, but even then there's not a single moment where the motion is being captured, because each frame is still stationary. So there's no way to actually capture movement at any moment in time, and so if you have no movements at all moments of time, then how does anything actually move? (A modern physics resolution is that motion is not what happens at a specific moment in time, but what happens between the moments of time.)   Graphing Data  The first chart represents the height of a ball as it is dropped. The positions are captured with a digital camera capturing 4 frames per second. The data is then plotted in a graph.  INSERT IMAGE  The second chart represents the current measured across a circuit for various resistances. (The volatge is kept constant.) This data is then plotted in a graph.  INSERT IMAGE     interpolation  extrapolation  Interpolation and Extrapolation  When working with discrete data, there are two important concepts to understand for trying to interpret the graph. Interpolation is the process of estimating the values in between measured points in the data, and extrapolation is the process of estimating the values beyond the measured points in the data. Interpolation is often accomplished by using \"straight-line\" estimates, meaning that you imagine drawing a straight line between the data points and then using that line to estimate the values of the function.  Extrapolation is much more complicated. It requires a sense of how the function behaves. Using a straight line to estimate a function that is more parabolic can lead to significant errors. It can also lead to answers that do not make sense. This is a place where graphs give way to formulas and theoretical considerations. We will not encounter these types of situations too frequently in this course, but it's important to understand the idea.       (Google) Google      "

  "body": " Basic Algebra     -----   ----     Equations Represent Relationships  Although this is a course in conceptual physics, there will still be equations that you will need to navigate. However, we will not be doing many complicated algebraic manipulations. Instead, we will be focusing on the ideas that are hidden in the equations.  The main intuitive concept that you need to understand is how variables change relative to one another. Specifically, if you focus on just two variables, what happens if one of them gets larger? Does the other one also get larger, or does it become smaller? This will ultimately depend on where the variables are relative to each other in the equation. But there are some situations where your intuition will be enough to tell you the answer. For a fixed distance, the amount of time it takes to travel that distance goes down as your speed goes up.  A more precise version of this is identifying the algebraic relationship between the variables. This is where you get into the prototypical shapes of curves, such as a linear relationship, a quadratic relationship, an inverse relationship, or an inverse square relationship. (There are others, but these are the more common ones.)    Solving Equations  Although we won't be doing a lot with equations, we will still need to do some basic calculations with them. This is not meant to be a full general lesson on solving equations, but rather just an overview of the more common ways we will need to solve equations for this course. The general principle that we use is that whatever we do to one side of the equation, we must do to the other side of the equation. This keeps the equation (the relationship between the variables) in balance.  The only mathematical operations we will be using to solve equations in this class are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, and square roots. Typically, you will be given the values of all of the variables except for one, and the task will be to solve for the last one. You will need to pay attention to both the number and the units. Even if you're not entirely sure of what the units mean, you should be able to follow the algebra to get the correct results.   Solving Problems  The formula is the relationship between constant velocity ( ), time ( ), and distance ( ). Here are a couple typical problems for this equation and their solutions.  Problem 1: Suppose a car is traveling at 70 miles per hour for 3 hours. How far will it travel?    Notice that the problem gives us a velocity (70 miles per hour) and a time (3 hours), and the question is asking us about a distance (\"How far...?\"). The first step is to plug the values into the equation.     We will simplify the left side of the equation. Notice that the units of hours cancel out, leaving just the unit of miles. Also notice that the arithmetic that is indicated is to calculate , which gives 210.     In this case, the equation is already solved for , so there is nothing more to do. This means that the answer is that the car will travel 210 miles.    Problem 2: A person is running towards a door that closes in 5 seconds. They are 20 meters from the door. How fast must they run in order to get to the door before it closes?    This problem gives you time (5 seconds) and distance (20 meters), and you need to determine speed (\"How fast...?\"). We will plug these values into the equation.     There is no arithmetic to do in this equation, so we will go straight into solving. The velocity variable is being multiplied by 5 seconds, and so we must divide both sides by 5 seconds to undo that and isolate the velocity variable.     We will now simplify the fraction on the right side. Notice that the number part of the calculation is , which is 4. And there is no cancellation in the units. This gives us the following:     This tells us that if the person runs at a speed of 4 meters per second, they will reach the door just as it closes. This means that in order for them to get to the door before it closes, they must run faster than 4 meters per second.       Unit Conversions   conversion factor Unit conversions are a particular manipulation that is important to understand and execute. The main concept is that any relationship between two units can be expressed as a ratio that is equivalent to the number 1 (which is called a conversion factor ), and then multiplying any quantity by 1 does not change it. From here, it's just a matter of doing algebra on the units to complete the conversion  Creating a conversion factor simply requires us to write a relationship as an equation, and then writing a fraction with one side as the numerator and the other side as the denominator. The arrangement that you will want will depend on the calculation you are doing.   Creating Conversion Factors  Consider the relationship \"12 inches is a foot.\" If we were to write this as an equation, it would look like this: . This means that the two conversion factors we could create are and .  Another example would be the relationship \"60 seconds in a minute.\" The equation would be , so that the conversion factors are and .   To choose which conversion factor to use, you need to think about how you would cancel the units. It turns out that units cancel out like numbers and variables in fractions. This means setting up the fraction so that the unit you want to eliminate is on the opposite side of the fraction (numerator and denominator) of the original.  Once the conversion factor has been chosen, it is an exercise in multiplying by fractions to complete the calculation. You can treat the number parts independently of the units. If you are converting multiple units, you can either do them all at once, or do it one step at a time. If you are less confident with your mathematical skills, it's probably better to do one unit at a time. (Note: We treat the singular and plural of a unit to be the same thing, so that, for example, second would cancel with seconds.)   Single Unit Conversion Calculations  Suppose we wanted to convert 144 inches to feet. We would start by identifying the relationship . Then we would need to decide how to get the inches to cancel out. Since inches are currently in the numerator, we would want our conversion factor to have the inches in the denominator. That leads us to pick . The rest is just arithmetic and algebra.     Multiple Unit Conversion Calculations  Suppose we wanted to convert 10 kilometers per hour to meters per second. We would need two relationships. One to convert kilometers to meters, and another to convert hours to seconds. The first relationship is . (We will talk about the system of prefixes in the next chapter.) Perhaps you know how many seconds there are in an hour, but how would you do it if you didn't? This will require multiple conversions.  The two relevant relationships are that there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. We can see that seconds and hours can be related to each other through minutes. The key idea here is that we can multiply conversion factors together to get another conversion factor. Specifically, we have the following:   This conversion factor tells us that there are 3600 seconds in an hour. This gives us the second conversion factor we need. We will do the calculation in steps, and then do it all at once. We will first convert km\/hr to m\/hr.   Now we will convert m\/hr to m\/s.   Doing the calculation all at once looks like this:      Powers of Units  In some cases, you will see units raised to powers. The most common example of this is that area is in units of length squared, such as or . We will also encounter units such as squared seconds ( ). When doing a unit conversion of a unit raised to a power, you need to include a conversion factor for each power of the unit you see. The easiest way to think about this is to just write out the product of the units without an exponent and convert them one at a time.   Unit Conversion with Exponents  Suppose you wanted to know how many cubic inches there are in a cubic foot. We would need to use three conversion factors to convert each of the feet into inches.

Perhaps you know how many seconds there are in an hour, but how would you do it if you didn't? This will require multiple conversions.  The two relevant relationships are that there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. We can see that seconds and hours can be related to each other through minutes. The key idea here is that we can multiply conversion factors together to get another conversion factor. Specifically, we have the following:   This conversion factor tells us that there are 3600 seconds in an hour. This gives us the second conversion factor we need.

  "title": "Variation Relationships",
  "body": " Variation Relationships     -----   ----   In some situations, it makes sense to describe the relationship between variables using words rather than equations. This can often bring additional focus and attention to the core structure of the relationship and can avoid getting lost in the equations. We are going to focus on two specific phrasings that are used to discuss these relationships.    Direct or Proportional Variation   direct variation  constant of proportionality The idea of two variables being \"in proportion\" to each other is that they form a constant ratio. This is known as a direct variation . A simple example is purchasing items (without a bulk discount). If a burger is $4, then 2 burgers is $8, 3 burgers is $12, and so on. The ratio of number of burgers to the cost remains the same. There are two mathematical phrasings that capture this type of relationship. The first is \" is proportional to \" and the other is \" varies directly with (or as) .\" As an equation, this is often written as , which means that for some constant . This constant is known as the constant of proportionality .  When two variables are directly proportional to each other, it establishes a linear relationship between them. This means that if one increases, so does the other, and always in an equal proportion of the amount of increase. This type of relationship appears throughout physics, though it usually requires assuming that certain other variables are being held constant. Here are a few examples (and don't worry if you don't understand them right now):    Distance is proportional to the time traveled (at a constant speed): .    Voltage is proportional to the current (with a constant resistance): .    Force is proportional to the accerlation (with a constant mass): .    The reason for the notation is that we don't always care about the value of the constant of proportionality. It emphasizes the variables in the relationship without needing to introduce another symbol that would need to be defined or discussed. However, when it comes to working through problems, we almost always see that constant of proportionality show up.    Inverse Variation   inverse variation Direct variations have the property that both variables increase or decrease together. Inverse variations have the property that the two variables move in opposite directions. So as one variable increases, the other decreases. The common phrasing for this is \" is inversely proportional to ,\" and is often written as . Here are a few examples:    Speed is inversely proportional to the time traveled (for a constant distance): .    Current is inversely proportional to the resistance (with a constant voltage): .    Acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass (with a constant force): .    This phrasing can be used to loosely indicate that the two variables move in opposite directions from each other. For example, one might say something like \"fun is inversely proportional to the amount of work that needs to be done\" to mean that there's more fun when there's less work and that there's less fun when there is more work. However, in the context of physics, it can only mean the precise mathematical relationship above.    Joint and Combined Variations   joint variation  combined variation Joint and combined variations are variations with more than two variables. Technically, a joint variation is a variation built from two direct variations. So the phrase \" varies jointly with and \" means that . (You will also see \" is proportional to and \".) This is different from a combined variation , which is a combination of a direct variation and an inverse variation. Fortunately, the relationships are expressed explicitly in the language. For example, we would say \" varies directly with and inversely with \" to mean that .  With these types of variations, there is only one constant of proportionality. In other words, means , as opposed to something like . The reason for this that there is no benefit to introducing extra constants. In the end, the two constants can just be multiplied together into one, and we wouldn't be able to determine two separate constants without having to introduce another equation.    Variations with Variable Expressions  The most general type of relationships that we can have with variables allow us to not just have a variable, but a variable expression. This should be seen as just a standard symbolic substitution. For example, the phrase \" is inversely proportional to the square of \" takes the phrase \"the square of \" and replaces it with , and then the relationship can be written as . This can be done in all sorts of ways. Here are some examples:    The distance an object falls when dropped is proportional to the gravitational acceleration and the square of the time: .    The gravitational force between two objects is proportional to the product of the masses of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them: .

  "title": "Vectors",
  "body": " Vectors     -----   ----    vector The language of physics includes a number of important mathematical objects. Vectors are among the most central type of mathematical object because it is used to represent everything from forces to positions to electric fields. A vector is a mathematical quantity that includes information about both a direction and a magnitude (or length). This section is just a brief, minimally mathematical introduction to the topic. It's not uncommon for people studying physics to take an entire course to help them understand what vectors are and how to do calculations with them. We are not going to need much more than the basic ideas and a minimal amount of vector algebra.    Two Representations of Vectors  There are two ways that we represent vectors in physics classes. The first is a geometric representation and the second is an algebraic one. The geometric representation is great for building up intuition and an understandig of certain concepts, but it's not so good for actually performing calculations. The algebraic representation is great for doing calculations, but it's easy to lose track of the big picture when working with them. In the end, you will want to be familiar with both perspectives.  The most natural way to geometrically capture the concepts of direction and magnitude in a picture is by drawing an arrow. If we think about the arrow as an instruction that tells us which way to push an object, we can match our push so that it goes in the same direction as the arrow, and then the length of the arrow is an indicator of how hard to push. A short arrow is a light push and a long arrow is a strong push. We can also translate this concept into the velocity of an object. The arrow says that the object is moving in that direction and we use its length to indicate how fast it's going.   head, vector  tail, vector We call the starting point of the arrow the tail of the vector, and the tip of the arrow the head of the vector. It's important to note that the vector itself does not have a location. It only tells us about the relative positions of the starting and ending locations of the vector. In other words, we can slide the vector around the plane (without rotating it) and it doesn't change the vector itself.   components, vector The algebraic notation feels a lot like how we plot points in the plane. A vector that points spaces to the right and spaces up is denoted by . Notice that the brackets are pointed rather than being round. This small shift in notation gives is what indicates the difference between a vector and a point. The and values are called the components of the vector (or vector components ). More specifically, if the diagram is oriented in the \"traditional\" manner, the first component corresponds to the part of the vector that points in the horizontal direction, and the second component corresponds to the part of the vector that points in the vertical direction. There are more complicated ways to interpret the components of a vector, but we won't be needing them for this class.   standard position, vector If draw the vector with its tail at the origin, we say that the vector is in standard position . In this case, the algebraic notation for the vector \"matches\" with the coordinates of the head. That is, when the vector is drawn in standard position, the head of the vector will be located at the point . However, this only happens when the vector is in standard position. If the tail is somewhere else, then the head of the vector is found relative to the tail, and it will no longer correspond to the point.    Vector Addition  The geometric picture of vector addition is to think about a triangle. If we are given two vectors, you draw them \"tail-to-head\" often intuitively framed as combining movements back-to-back. In other words, we think of the vectors as representing motion, and follow the motions in sequence. This is precisely what position vectors do for us, but it's not necessarily the best image if the vectors represented something else, like forces or electric fields. In those cases, the core concept isn't motion, and so this doesn't create the best picture. So the more general way of thinking about geometric vector addition is known as the method of adding vectors. This accomplishes the same thing, but avoids the concept of \"movement\" in the process.  Algebraically, vector addition is accomplished by performing \"component-wise\" addition. That is, if we wanted to calculate , the result is attained by adding the components that are in the same position, which gives . The good news is that this is what most students would naturally end up doing. It's not hard to see that this gives the same result as the geometric method because the horizontal and vertical directions are independent of each other.    Scalar Multiplication  Multiplying a vector by a scalar (a number) results in stretching the vector by the scalar value and flipping the direction if the scalar is negative. Geometrically, this is straight-forward. Algebraically, this is accomplished by multiplying each of the components by the scalar. It turns out that the underlying mathematics is nothing more than the distributive property, but those are details that we don't need to get into here.    Vectors in Context  One of the most important ideas to keep in mind with vectors is that (at least in physics) they always exist in a specific context. In other words, the vectors mean something about the physical world, and so when we add vectors or multiply vectors by a scalar, it will correspond to some sort of physical outcome. Without going into detail, here are some examples.   Position Vectors  Vectors can be used to represent position. More precisely, they are used to represent the position relative to some location. In this case, the addition of vectors corresponds to sequential movement. So if the first vector is the vector corresponding to 3 meters north ( , assuming north is up) and the second vector is the vector corresponding to 1 meter east and 2 meters south ( ), then after doing those movements back-to-back you will end up in a location that is 1 meter east and 1 meter north of where you started. In other words,     Velocity Vectors  Vectors can be used to represent velocity. The direction of the vector is the direction of motion, and the length of the vector is the speed. The addition of vectors represents the combined speed when both types of motion are considered. If a train is moving at 150 km\/hr and you're on the train walking towards the front at 3 km\/hr, then you would be moving at 153 km\/hr relative to the ground.  Similarly, if a plane is flying north at 900 km\/hr ( ) and a wind is blowing to the east at 150 km\/hr ( ), then we can add those vectors together to get the velocity of the plane relative to the ground.     Force Vectors  Vectors can be also used to represent forces. If multiple forces are being applied to an object, the net force that the object experiences is the vector sum of all of the forces that are acting on it. If two people were each pushing a block with 250 N force in the same direction, we would expect the block to behave as if a single 500 N force were acting on it. But if they were pushing in opposite directions, then the two vectors are now pointing in opposite directions, and the two forces cancel each other out.

While it's possible to have an entire course on trigonometry, we will only be focusing on the basic geometric ideas of trigonometry.    Pythagorean Theorem  The Pythagorean Theorem   hypotenuse  legs (of a right triangle) We will start with a simple right triangle. The longest side of a right triangle is known as the hypotenuse and the other two sides are called legs . The Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs. But that's not typically how people remember it. If we were to label the lengths of the legs as and , and the length of the hypotenuse as , then we would have the relationship , which is the way most people remember it.    Sine and Cosine  The core trigonometric relationship we need for physics are the relationships for the sine and cosine functions for right triangles. If we draw a right triangle and label one of the acute angles , we can label the sides according to the following DIAGRAM and have the following relationships:   The sine and cosine functions are mathematical functions whose values you will get from a scientific calculator. Most of the work we will do at this level will have the angles measured in degrees, and you will want to make sure that your calculator is in the correct mode.  Here are the graphs of the sine and cosine functions. There is a lot that could be said about these functions, but the main thing to focus on is the shape of these graphs between 0 degrees and 90 degrees. The sine function starts at 0 and increases to 1, while the cosine function starts at 1 and decreases to 0, and the two graphs have the same value at 45 degrees.  GRAPHS    Tangent  The tangent function is another trigonometric function. It's defined by . Since this function is defined in terms of sine and cosine, we technically don't even need it. However, this combination ends up being quite useful, and so it's worth knowing about it. The tangent function is usually found in the context of slopes, and it has the property that its value is 0 when the angle is 0, and this value gets infinitely large as the angle approaches 90 degrees. At this point, we won't say anything more about it.    Applications   vector decomposition The basic applications of trigonometry in physics are to determine the length of the side of a triangle and to determine an angle. The most common configuration that we see is that we know the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle and we know one of the angles, and our task is to determine the lengths of the two legs. In the context of vectors, this is often referred to as vector decomposition .  The following diagram is useful enough that it's worth memorizing. The assumptions here are that you know the angle and that the length of the hypotenuse is . Then by using the formulas for sine and cosine, you can determine the lengths of the two legs. This triangle shows up in many different orientations, and so you won't want to remember it in terms of the words \"horizontal\" and \"vertical.\" That will lead to many errors. It is better to remember that the cosine function is adjacent to the angle and the sine function is opposite the angle.

But it turns out that those teachers were wrong. However, this doesn't mean that everyone really understands how to use their calculator, or that every calculator is the same. This lab activity will have you use a number of different types of calculators and try to identify particular quirks that they may have.    Equipment List    At least two different cellphone calculators    Internet access to use following online calculators:     (TheOnlineCalculator.com) Basic Calculator      (Online-Calculator.com) Standard Calculator      (Desmos.com) Scientific Calculator         Procedure  We are going to investigate the calculators and learn about their individual quirks. You will want to take notes throughout so that you will be able to remember the information you need for the write-up.    Determine the following information about the two cellphone calculators and three online calculators:    Basic calculator information (cellphone calculators only): Determine the cell phone brand, calculator name, and calculator version. (Note: The calculator might just be called \"calculator.\" The version information might be difficult to find, but it's there somewhere. You might find the information in the app store.)    Calculator type: Basic or scientific. (Note: Some calculators allow you to use either mode. If so, indicate this and use scientific mode for the rest of the lab.)    Execution style: Infix or immediate execution    Parentheses, square, and square root: Determine whether the calculator allows the use of parentheses, the squaring function, and the square root function.    Scientific Notation: Determine whether the calculator accepts scientific notation. (Note: If the calculator is infix and has an exponentiation function, then you can use scientific notation. But some calculators will have an E or EE button for scientific notation.)      We will use the calculators to calculate some values. The purpose is to compare the relative difficulty of getting the correct answers. In some cases, you might be able to perform the entire calculation in a single step. But in other cases, you may need to perform multiple separate calculations to get the correct result. Be sure to make note of any challenges you encounter.    Calculate . The correct result is 1.    Calculate . The correct result is 7.    Calculate . The correct result is 7.       We will now test some of the limits of the calculators. Perform the following tasks on each calculator.    Calculate and count the total number of digits that are displayed (including the leading zero). Then calculate and count the number of digits that are displayed. Indicate whether there are more, fewer, or the same number of digits in the display.    Determine the highest power of 10 that the calculator will accept without giving an error. This is easiest on calculators that have exponentiation or scientific notation. If it does not have these features, it will be helpful to use the \"Ans\" feature (uses the answer of the last calculation as part of the next calculation) or the memory feature to store large powers of ten. Make a note of the error it gives when it breaks.    If the calculator has a square root function, determine the maximum number of 9s needed for the calculator to display that . (Note: It is possible that for some calculators, it will not display this result even for a large number of 9s. If that happens on one of your calculators, just indicate this.)      We will now engage in some \"stress tests\" of the calculators. The goal is to see whether we can make the calculator make mistakes. Note that if the instruction says to \"calculate\" a quantity, it means to have the calculator evaluate the result by pressing the equal sign (or equivalent button).    Calculate . Do not add parentheses or make other adjustments to force the calculator to get the right answer. We want to see how the calculator interprets this. The correct answer is 7, but some calculators will give 9 as the answer.    Calculate and then multiply that result by . The correct answer is 1, but not all calculators will give this result.    Calculate with as many 9s are needed to give a result of 1. Then square the result. The correct answer is with as many 9s as you entered when you started. However, some calculators will have rounding error and simply return a value of 1.    For calculators with a squaring function and a square root function, start with and square as many times as needed to get a result of 0. Then take the square root. The correct answer is a very small positive one, but some calculators will give 0. For calculators that give a small positive number square twice and take the square root twice to see if it makes a difference. Continue squaring more and more times until it gets stuck at 0.    For calculators that have parentheses and inline notation (so that fractions appear as or instead of ), calculate . If the calculator does not give an error, indicate what answer it gave. (Note: This calculation is hotly debated on the internet, and it is known that different calculators give different answers. What the \"right\" answer is and whether there even a \"right\" answer depends on who you ask.)        Discussion  Answer the following questions.    Based on your experiences, which calculator would you say is the \"best\" one? The \"worst\" one? (Note: It's possible for multiple calculators to tie for best or worst. This is purely subjective.) What are your reasons for your rankings? Also indicate if there is disagreement within the group about these answers.    Did any of the stress test results surprise you? What about them was surprising?      Conclusion  It's a common assumption that everyone knows how to use a calculator. This assumption is true for very basic calculations, but it's often false when more complex calculations are involved. Was there anything new that you learned about calculators from this activity?

  "body": " The Metric System is the Tool of the Devil!   Introduction     The metric system is the tool of the devil! My car gets forty rods to the hogshead, and that's the way I likes it!   Abraham Simpson (Grandpa Simpson)    imperial system While most of the world and all of science operates using the metric system, daily life in the US usually revolves around the imperial system of measurement. This is the system of quarts, gallons, feet, and miles that you're probably most accustomed to seeing. In fact, there are only three countries in the world that officially operate on the imperial system! (The other two countries are Liberia and Myanmar.)  The reason the imperial system is called that is because it was originally the system of units imposed on countries by the British Empire during the time of colonialism (imperial means \"of the empire\"). Somewhat confusingly, the imperial system wasn't formalized until the 1820s. Before that, there was a vast array of customary measures used in various locations, some of which date back to the 1500s (and potentially even earlier).  The actual origins of individual measurements were often rather arbitrary. For example, the length we call a foot today was originally the length of King Henry I's foot. And an inch has been defined muliple ways, including the length of three grains of barley laid end-to-end and the length of twelve poppy seeds. There are also other historical measurements that are similarly arbitrary, such as a cubit (the length from your elbow to the tip of your outstretched middle finger) and a league (the distance a person can walk in an hour). Of course, differences in individual human bodies made these measurements to be rough estimates at best. And the convoluted history and origins of these measurements have led to the equally convoluted relationships between them, such as 5280 feet in a mile.  For this lab, we are going to explore some more of the history of different units and practice making unit conversions using the imperial system.    Procedure  This lab consists of a lot of calculations. When doing your calculations, show the multiplication by the appropriate conversion factors and make sure that the units cancel appropriately.    As noted above, an inch has been interpreted as being the length of three grains of barley laid end-to-end and as the length of twelve poppy seeds. From this information, estimate the average length of a grain of barley and the average length of a poppy seed. (Use a three digit decimal approximation.)    Research the size of grains of barley and poppy seeds. How close are your calculations in the previous step to the values you found?    Sticking with the historical relationships, we can establish two length equalities: and . Use these relationships to perform the following unit conversions:    Convert 5 feet to poppy seeds.    Convert 12 yards to grains of barley.    Convert 2 miles to poppy seeds.    Convert 600 poppy seeds to grains of barley.      Another set of linear units were used for agricultural purposes. These are rods, chains, and furlongs. A chain is 4 rods, and a furlong is 10 chains. If you are familiar with horse racing, you probably know that there are 8 furlongs in a mile. From this information, determine the length of rods, chains, and furlongs in feet. Then perform the following unit conversions:    Convert 200 yards to chains.    Convert 100 feet to rods.    Convert 1 furlong to poppy seeds.      Liquid measurements often developed from commercial operations involving alcohol. You might know that both wine and whiskey are aged in barrels, but you might not know that the traditional sizes of the barrels are different for each beverage. Barrels are also related to other cask sizes, such as a hogshead and a tun. We are going to focus on the wine cask units, where a tun is 210 gallons, there are 4 hogsheads per tun, and 2 barrels per hogshead. Convert the quantities of barrels and hogsheads to gallons.    If Grandpa Simpson's car gets forty rods to the hogshead, how many miles per gallon is he getting? Is this good or bad? How many barley seeds per tun does he get?      Discussion  These questions will ask you to reflect on your experiences doing these calculations.    You calculated the number of poppy seeds in 2 miles. If you were to line up that many poppy seeds, do you expect the actual total length to be close to 2 miles? Why or why not?    It is likely that there was never a direct connection between the lengths of grains of barley and furlongs. Why do you think this is the case?    Do you think that the units of rods, chains, and furlongs is more or less \"logical\" than feet, inches, and miles? What features do you think make for a \"logical\" system of measurements?      Conclusion  This lab activity is mostly about practicing your unit conversions. Hopefully, you are more comfortable with them after having completed it.

  "title": "Numbers and Units",
  "body": " Numbers and Units    -----   ------   In order to explore physics, we need to work with numbers and units. So before we launch into physics, we have to spend a little bit of time understanding what those things are.  Here is a seemingly simple question: What is the number three? Yes, you can draw the arabic numeral 3 and say that this is 3. But that doesn't really get at the question, since there are lots of ways to write the number 3. We can also write three using a system of tally marks, or using numbers from a different language. Your next impulse might be to try gather three objects and say that these objects represent the number three. But is that true? How would we know from this that if we grabbed three other objects that those other things would also be three?  It turns out that the question of \"What is a number?\" is extremely complicated and can lead down rich paths of mathematical philosophy. For example, we can think about numbers in terms of their properties (numbers behave like this) or we can try to think about the \"essence\" of numbers (what makes a number a number and not something else?). And as you get deeper into the subject, you'll find that there is not a single simple answer to the question. (This is another example of how simple questions can lead to complicated answers.)  For our purposes, we will stick with the idea that numbers are symbols that represent a quantity or an amount. You might ask, \"A quantity or amount of what?\" And that's a good question to ask. Numbers don't tell us that. They just represent the abstract concept of quantity or amount. In order to know what sorts of things we have quantities of, we have to add a unit.   unit A unit is a word that represents a known quantity that represents a standard for a measurement. In casual contexts, the known quantity can be something simple like an apple. It makes sense for us to say that there are \"five apples\" on the table. However, from a more scientific perspective, an \"apple\" is not precise enough for us to use for our studies. What type of apples are they? And even if we have the same variety of apple (say, red delicious apples), they can be of many different weights and sizes. This makes for a very imprecise form of measurement.   Why are red delicious apples called that? If you've ever had them, they are perhaps among the least delicious apples that are out there! Apparently, they used to taste better, but over the years they have been bred for things like rotting slowly and not being easily bruised, and not bred for taste. Basically, the red delicious apple is a victim of modern capitalism.   When it comes to science, we have to use very precise quantities to avoid this type of variation. This will be the topic of the next section.  "

  "title": "SI Base Units",
  "body": " SI Base Units     I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it.   Lord Kelvin    SI  International Bureau of Weights and Measures The units used in modern science are known as SI units. SI stands for the \"International System of Units\" (from the French Système international d'unités ). These units were created by an organization called the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and is an agreed-upon standard that is officially used by almost every country in the world and the entirety of the modern scientific community. We are going to take a brief tour of a few of the units, which form the foundation for all other scientific units.    Seconds   second A second is a unit of time. Measuring the passage of time is something that we use in our daily lives and the second is the smallest common unit of time that we use for that purpose. But the technical definition of a second is somewhat surprising. The statement below is taken from the 9th edition of the \"SI brochure\" :   [The second] is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, , the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to .   What does this mean? Basically, it means that a second is defined by watching an atom and counting how quickly it bounces back and forth between two states. After about 9 billion of those transitions have occured, we say that a second has passed.  Historically, seconds have been a subdivision of a long unit of time. You would take a day, break it into 24 hours, break each hour into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds, and that would result in having a second be of a day. The problem with this definition is that a day is not a fixed unit of time. It turns out that the spin of the earth is decreasing at a rate of about 1.8 milliseconds every century (and this is only an average). This means that our measurements would be slowly shifting as well, and that's not what we want to see out of our science.  At a deeper level, it ties our concept of time to something that's not consistently measurable. If we were able to get a consistent and perfectly exact measurement of a day (and this time period is something that never changes), then we could theoretically tie our calculations to it. But we can't, and so scientists have tried to come up with something that they think would satisfy the requirements.   While this may seem random, we have used vibrations of quartz crystals to keep consistent time since the 1940s. And that was the start of the pathway that has taken us to where we are.     Meters   meter A meter is a unit of distance, and it is the distance that light travels in of a second. It turns out that this is about 39 inches, or a few inches longer than a yard. But why would this be the definition? It turns out that one of the laws of physics is that the speed of light is the same for all observers. This claim takes a bit to unpack, because it's a deeply unintuitive result that leads to all sorts of interesting consequences. So for now, we'll just say that the speed of light is a universal constant, which makes it a useful value for making measurements. The specific denominator of the fraction comes the speed of light being exactly 299,792,458 meters per second. And this also presents a chicken-and-egg problem. We use the speed of light to define a distance, but then we can't make sense of that distance that without measuring the speed of light.  Humans have been measuring distance for much longer than we have known the speed of light. And there were multiple iterations of the distance of a meter, but each of those were found to be imprecise. For example, an early definition of a meter was connected to the length of a particular pendulum to make it oscillate with a specific frequency, but that length turned out to be different in different locations (due to the fact that gravity changes with altitude). Another attempted meter was to define it to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator, but that measurement assumes the earth is smooth enough to make that meaningful. And while neither of those two methods were perfect, they did create an expectation for what a meter ought to be. And so the choice of declaring that the speed of light is exactly 299,792,458 meters per second was to create an integer value that also wouldn't significantly alter the existing meter.    Kilograms   kilogram  mass  weight  force A kilogram is a unit of mass. Mass is a somewhat complicated quantity to measure because it gets mixed up with a related but different concept of weight . The mass is basically the amount of matter in the object. If there's more mass in one object than another, it means that there's more matter in that object compared to the other. But how would we know how much matter there is? Our first intuition might be to weight it, and then we can say that there's more matter in the one that weighs more. This leads to the correct conclusion, but it's deceptive about the nature of matter.   gravity  intertia  International Space Station (ISS) You might be familiar with the idea that objects weigh less on the moon than they do on earth, and this is related to the concept of gravity . Since the gravity changes from one location to another, it makes it hard to really use gravity as the way to determine mass. In fact, if we were to put objects into orbit on the International Space Station (or ISS), we could not use weight at all since everything would weigh nothing! So a better concept of mass is to think about inertia , which is a measure of how hard it is to change the motion of something. Even though objects have no weight in space, it still takes a certain amount of effort to move them. Objects with more mass are harder to move than objects with less mass. And the difficulty of moving an object (not its weight) is what we should be thinking of when we think about mass.  You might have noticed that we haven't given the definition of a kilogram yet. That's because the definition is connected to a quantity known as Planck's constant . This is the number that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency. But to understand what that means, we would have to get into quantum mechanics, and that's just a lot to take in. So it's better to just hold the concept of mass without worrying about its formal definition.    The Other SI Units   ampere  kelvin  mole  candela There are four other SI units.

  "title": "SI Prefixes",
  "body": " SI Prefixes     -----   -----   One of the key values to the SI system is that there is a corresponding system of prefixes that scale the units up and down by powers of 10. All of this helps to make these values mathematically easier to work with when performing unit conversions, especially when compared to the unit conversions of the imperial system.    What are the SI Prefixes?  SI prefixes are letters or words that are placed before a unit in order to modify its meaning. This gives us the ability to scale our units up or down so that the quantities we use in a particular setting are simpler. This is similar to other unit decisions, where we pick the unit to be convenient for the problem that we are attempting to solve or the the situation that we find ourselves in. For example, it's more sensible to talk about 2 kilometers of distance instead of 2,000,000 millimeters. Another way to think about this is that these prefixes allow us to \"hide\" some of the scientific notation in the units in order to simplify the communication of values.  Here is a chart of some of the SI prefixes:   SI Prefixes and Multipliers    Prefix  Symbol  Exponent Form  Standard Form    tera  T      giga  G      mega  M      kilo  k      hecto  h      deca  da      --  --      deci  d      centi  c      milli  m      micro  μ      nano  n      pico  p         How to Use the SI Prefixes  The prefixes allow you to easily relate values back to the base unit. For example, is equivalent to . Similarly, is equivalent to . However, if you're going from the base unit to the prefix, you will need to change the sign of the exponent. So is the same as and is equivalent to .  You can also create conversion factors by using two prefixes and the base unit. For example, to convert megavolts to millivolts, you would start with and simply replace both sides with the appropriate equivalent: . From here, it's just a matter of building the correct fraction for the desired outcome.  In these examples, we've used the full names of the units. But in practice, the units have abbreviations. For example, instead of writing \"volts\" we would just use \"V\". So a 5V batter is a \"5 volt\" battery. When using the abbreviated units, you also use the abbreviated symbol for the prefix. So \"MV\" is \"megavolt\" and \"mV\" is millivolt. Notice that the capitalization matters.

For example, speed is the measure of how far an object travels in a particular amount of time. This means that we can't have speed unless we have both distance and time. The purpose of the SI base units is that it gives us the foundation upon which we can build all of the other physics concepts. Everything from here forward will involve some combination of those units.  Here are some examples of some physics concepts and their associated units:    Speed ( ): A measure of how far an object travels in a particular amount of time.    Acceleration ( ): A measure of the change of speed over a period of time.    Force ( ): A measure of the push or pull applied to an object. Since this unit is used so frequently in combination with other units, it is given its own symbol (Newtons). Mathematically speaking, this unit is just a substitution that allows us to write certain combinations of units in a less complicated manner.    Some of the units are given names to simplify the concepts. For example, the unit of force is a Newton, and it can be understood as the amount of force needed to accelerate a one kilogram mass at the the rate of one meter per second squared. There are also some concepts that have units that are easily calculated, but are extremely challenging to describe directly. For example, momentum is calculated as the product of mass and velocity, but what it measures might be described as the amount of stored motion within a mass.

At least one of the following measuring boards:    4 ft x 8 ft plywood with stripes every 25 cm in the long direction (painted stripes, colored duct tape, etc.)    1\" x 6\" x 8 ft board with stripes every 25 cm (pained stripes, colored duct tape, etc.)      Tennis ball (or other ball that can be thrown safely)    Paper\/pen\/pencil to write down the times.      Procedure  The general task is to determine the speed of various objects by either using slow motion video or a stopwatch. The different tasks will be grouped by how they will be measured.    Mark out a 25-meter straight-line course and time the following behaviors with a stopwatch. Each person in the lab group should participate (if possible), and each measurement should be taken three times.    The time it takes for a person to cover the distance while walking at a \"normal\" pace (whatever feels natural to them).    The time it takes for a person to cover the distance starting from standing still and running as fast as they are comfortable. (Please take care not to injure yourself!)      Set up the measuring board in a safe area. Use the slow-motion video option on the cellphone to capture the object in motion. Your field of view for the camera should around twice as wide as the board. If you are too close, there will be too much distortion of distances due to the gap between the object and the board. If you are too far, you won't be able to see when the object clears the markings very well.    Throw a ball as fast as you can. It may take several attempts to capture usable footage. The ball should go past at about the same height as the measuring board. The goal is to get three successful attempts. (Try not to damage the phone or the person holding the phone!)    Run past the measuring board at your fastest comfortable speed. (In theory, this should be the same as the 25-meter run.) The measuring board should be about waist level, and you should try to focus on the same part of the body for each measurement.        Sample Charts   25-Meter Walk (in Seconds)      Walk #1  Walk #2  Walk #3  Average Walk    Student A    Student B    Student C      25-Meter Run (in Seconds)      Run #1  Run #2  Run #3  Average Run    Student A    Student B    Student C      25-cm Throw (in Frames)      Throw #1  Throw #2  Throw #3  Average Throw    Student A    Student B    Student C      25-cm Run (in Frames)      Run #1  Run #2  Run #3  Average Run    Student A    Student B    Student C       Discussion    Explain how you can convert the table of times for the 25-meter walk or run into speed in meters per second. Then convert the values to speed.    The average walking speed for an adult is typically between 1.2 and 1.4 m\/s, but there are lots of variables that contribute to this, such as age, height, and individual characteristics. Did anyone in the group walk faster or slower than typical? Was that person aware of this before this lab?    Determine the framerate for the camera that was used for the slow motion footage. How much time does one frame represent?    Convert the average frame count for ball throw into seconds, and then convert those values to speed in meters per second. Organize these values into a table. Which student has the fastest and slowest average speeds? Is there any relevant information that might explain why these individuals' are what they are?    Convert the average frame count for the run into seconds, and then convert those values to speed in meters per second. Organize these values into a table. Compare these results with the times attained from the 25-meter run. Explain why it should make sense that the 25-meter speed is slower than the 25-cm speed.      Conclusion  We have explored two methods of measuring speed in this lab. Both methods come down to directly measuring the amount of time required for an object to travel a specific distance, which is the basic definition of the concept of speed. And while speeds were the ultimate result of our calculations, the activity of the lab was more about making measurements. We measured out markers to indicate distances and we used different both a stopwatch and digital video to measure time.

  "body": " My Body is My Measuring Device   Introduction    Liberals get angry and tell us that the metric system is more \"rational\" than the measurements everyone understands. This is ridiculous. An inch is the width of a man's thumb, a foot the length of his foot, a yard the length of his belt. That's easy to visualize. How do you visualize 147.2 centimeters?   Ann Coulter   Ignoring the politics beind an op-ed that was written by a political firebrand in 2014, there's an interesting point about understanding measurements. All measurements are grounded in a history of trying to relate quantities to each other. In particular, lengths are historically related to lengths of things that people encounter all of the time, such as the length of an adult male foot or the size of a thumb. That said, these heuristic measurements are inaccurate because different people have different bodies.  This lab is about coming to understand your own body and learning how to estimate measurements with it. More specifically, you are going to develop metric intuition with your body. Familiarity with units comes with experience, and we're going to develop a set of experiences to help you become familiar with these values.    Equipment List    30-cm ruler    Meter stick    30 m (100 ft) tape measure    Cones or other markers that can be used to indicate positions on the ground    Tape    Paper and scissors    Objects and locations to measure.      Procedure  Every member of the group will perform a series of measurements to understand the dimensions of their body, and then practice making measurements with them.    Using the ruler, perform the following measurements:    Thumb width: Press your thumb onto the ruler to determine its width in cm. Note that different thumbs have different amounts of \"squishiness\" and so consistency of how you press your thumb matters. It works best to press you thumb in a way that \"feels natural\" to you. Don't try to \"remember\" how hard you have to press in order to achieve a certain dimension, because that's something you're unlikely to remember.    Hand span: Open your hand with your thumb and pinky finger spread out, and measure the distance from the tip of one to the tip of the other in cm. Just as with the thumb width, you want to do it in a way that is consistent, and whatever \"feels natural\" when you're doing this is probably the best option. You should not be trying to get the maximum possible distance.      Using the meter stick, perform the following measurements:    Cubit: A cubit is the distance from the tip of the elbow to the tip of the middle finger when the fingers are held straight out. Measure this directly on the meter stick. Give the result in cm.    Shoe length: Directly measure the length of your shoe. Give the result in cm.    Heel-to-toe step length: Using the meter stick, mark off a distance of 50 cm and 100 cm on the ground from a fixed starting point. Count the number of heel-to-toe steps that are needed to get to either the 50 cm mark or 100 cm mark. The mark you pick should be the one that ends the closest to an exact number of for your shoe size. It's likely that you will be \"just a little\" long or short. Try to estimate this to the quarter-shoe length. Give the result in cm.      Using the 30 meter tape measure, perform the following measurements:    Arm span: The arm span is the distance from finger tip to finger tip when both arms are held out to the side. This should be measurable directly, but it might be difficult to do by yourself. Give the result in meters.    Single step length: We will call a \"single step\" a step where you start with your feet side-by-side and take a single step forward, and then bringing your feet back to the side-by-side position. Using tape or other markings on the ground, create a starting line and line your toes up with it. Then take a single step and mark the final position of your feet. Then use those to measure your \"single step\" length. Give the result in meters    Pacing step length: A \"pacing step\" is a step that you make while walking normally. This is difficult to measure directly since you would need to focus on your feet a lot to get a good measurable step (starting in the right place and ending in a way that is easily measurable). Instead, we will take an average pacing step by walking out a measured distance and counting the steps. Using the cones, mark off a starting position, then a 20-meter mark, a 25-meter mark, and a 30 meter mark. From the starting position, walk as naturally as you can while counting your steps. Pick the mark that most accurately captures an exact number of steps and use that information to calculate your \"pacing step\" length. Give the result in meters.      Now that you have some measurements to work with, you will now practice using your body to measure various objects. Use multiple measurements where it's reasonable to do so. Be sure to indicate the measurement in terms of the method (arm span, etc.) and give the final estimate in either cm or m, depending on which is more appropriate.    Take a piece of regular office paper and try to cut a rectangle whose dimensions are 10 cm by 15 cm. Then measure the rectangles with a ruler, and write down the results.    Estimate the width and height of a doorway. (You may require a step stool or chair to reach the top of the doorway.) Write down the estimates, then measure it directly.    Estimate the length and width of a room. Write down the estimatse, then measure it directly.        Sample Charts   Hand and Arm Measurements      Thumb width (cm)  Hand Span (cm)  Cubit (cm)  Arm Span (m)    Student A    Student B    Student C      Foot Measurements      Shoe (cm)  Heel-to-Toe (cm)    Student A    Student B    Student C      Walking Measurements      Single Step  Pacing Step    Student A    Student B    Student C       Discussion    How effective were you in using your body as a measuring tool? Were the estimates close to the actual values?    How close were the shoe length measurement and heel-to-toe measurements? Were you surprised by this result? If they seemed somewhat different, is there an explanation for why you got this result?    How close were the single step and pacing step measurements? Were you surprised by this result? If they seemed somewhat different, is there an explanation for why you got this result?    Did anyone seem to get consistently long or short estimates? How could that be addressed so that they can get better results?      Conclusion  The use of the human body to make measurements is deeply grounded in history, and the results are grounded in experience. Although there is value to having standardized measurements and tools to make those measurements, it's not always the case that there is access to those tools. In those situations, it can be helpful to understand the size of your own body and use that to make estimates.

  "body": " Position     Where am I? Who am I? How did I come to be here?   Søren Kierkegaard   \"Where am I?\" It seems like a simple question. But the concept of position in physics is not trivial, and it is at the base of a number of other physics concepts that we are going to develop. So it is important for us to have a firm foundation on this before we move forward.    Reference Points  How would you answer the question, \"Where am I?\" You might say you are in a particular classroom. Or perhaps you're in your bedroom. Regardless of how you describe your position, it will always be relative to something else. Your classroom is a specific room inside of a specific building. You could avoid referencing a building by giving your GPS position, but that position is relative to the earth. There is no such thing as an \"absolute\" position. Position is always measured relative to something else.   origin In mathematics, whenever we plot a point on the plane, we always start from a point that's called the origin . This is the point from which you originate your movement to locate the point. The same concept applies to physics. There will always be some position that is considered the origin for the particular problem, and that's the point from which all other positions are measured.For example, if we are thinking about a runner in a straight-line race, we might have the starting line be the origin and then measure distances towards the finish line. If we are thinking about the motion of the planets, it might make sense for us to take the sun as the origin.    Position and Time  For kinematics, we are interested in the position of an object at any moment in time. We will start with the one-dimensional problem of the straight-line race runner. When we say that this is a one-dimensional problem, we mean we can describe the position of the runner using just a single number , which in this case is the distance from the starting line to the runner (in meters). Let's say that the race begins at time . The position of the runner is at the start, and it increases over time. Let's say that at time (in seconds) the runner is at (meters from the starting line).  If we continue to chart the position of the runner every second, we would get a table of data that gives us an indication of where the runner is at any time. It is important to note that this table only tells us where the runner is at specific instants of time, and we have to try to infer the locations at other times. For example, if the runner is at at and at at , we might guess that the runner is at at time . However, you might also guess that the value of might be a little smaller than 2.5 because the runner is still speeding up. While we can make arguments about exactly what that should be, it's ultimately just an educated guess.  In more complex problems, we might need to track the position of the object using two or three numbers. For example, if we were tracking the location of a car in a city, we might have one number ( ) for the east-west position of the car and another number ( ) for the north-south position. Or if we were tracking the position of a drone, we might need three coordinates because we would also need to keep track of the height ( ).    Position as a Vector  Technically, position is always a vector. This is because the position is always given by two pieces of information: \"How far?\" and \"In what direction?\". When we have just a single variable, it's implied that one direction is the \"positive\" direction and the other is negative. When there are many dimensions, the variables together give us the instructions for how to determine the location of the object. The combination of going some distance in one direction followed by another movement is part of why vectors work so well. All of this is naturally communicated in the underlying vector algebra.    One-Dimensional Position Graphs  One way to represent the position of an object at different moments in time is to use a graph. Typically, the horizontal axis is the time axis and the vertical axis is the position variable (or one of the position variables, if working in multiple dimensions). As noted above, the only times at which we know the position of the object are the times where we have measurements. What happens in between is a guess.  This means that when we plot the graph, the points we have from the chart of data are exact, and if we were to try to sketch a curve that fits those points, we would be doing an interpolation, which means that we are guessing about the shape of the curve. Some students are in the habit of just connecting the dots with straight lines, while others try to smooth out their curve a bit. Both methods are prefectly acceptable and mathematically justifiable. And since we're not going to be doing a lot of interpolation calculations in this course, we're not going to get into the details of the mathematics of it all. The key point to keep in mind is that lines are easier to do calculations with but curves give more realistic results.    Graphing Position   Intro Text    Instructions  Instructions    "

  "title": "Velocity",
  "body": " Velocity     If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious sh-t.   Doctor Emmett Brown (Back to the Future)   It is highly probable that you have some basic intuition about speed just based on your general life experiences. The goal for this sections is not so much about teaching you something new, but helping you to formalize that intuition and make it more concrete.    Speed vs. Velocity   speed  velocity  Speed is a number that measures of how fast something is moving. Velocity is a vector that indicates how fast something is moving and in which direction. Under this framework, the magnitude of velocity is the speed, and speed is never a negative value. In common usage, speed and velocity are often interchangeable. However, from the definitions you can see that they are not interchangable in physics courses. So just be aware of the distinction and do your best to practice being precise in your language.    Defining Velocity  Although we have a lot of experience with velocity, it takes a bit of thought to translate those experiences into something formal. In order for there to be velocity, there must be some amount of motion. And that motion will require an amount of time. Velocity is made up of the ratio of those two quantities. Specifically, we define velocity as , where is the change in position during the observed movement, and is the amount of time the movement took. Notice that this creates a unit of , such as meters per second or miles per hour.   Basic Velocity Calculation: Driving to the Beach  Suppose you are going to drive to the beach. Let's say that leave the house at 7 AM and arrive at the beach 9 AM and the beach is 120 miles away from your home. Your change in position is 120 miles and the amount of time it took for you to complete that change of position is 2 hours. Therefore, we would say that your velocity for the trip was .   This formula is often rewritten as , or more simply as .    Average and Instantaneous Velocity   velocity, average Technically, this formula gives us the average velocity . The reason is that this calculation doesn't take into account all of the nuances of what happens between the start and end of the motion. In the example, it's probably the case that the car stopped somewhere along the way (at a stop sign or traffic light), and at that moment the car was not moving at 60 miles per hour. Simiarly, it's likely that the car was driving faster than 60 mph on the freway. But because the elapsed time is so large, all of those details are lost and we are only left with the overall picture.   velocity, instantaneous Another way to think about the velocity is to try to keep track of all of those details. Rather than just thinking about the starting and stopping times and positions, we want to know what was happening at every moment of the trip. We would call that the instantaneous velocity . It's not hard to imagine creating a chart of values for velocity at specific times along the trip, similar to how we can create a chart of the position at any time. However, there's an interesting question that arises from this. What do we even mean by \"velocity at a specific time\"? How would we measure it? Velocity requires movement, and movement requires time, so we will always need both a start time and a stop time for any measurement, and they can't be the same. This brings us back to the arrow paradox! The Arrow Paradox   We will say more about this in a later section, but the if we practically want to try to get instantaneous velocity, we need to collect data in small enough increments that any change in velocity between the start and stop time is \"small enough\" to be ignored. So if we imagine two consecutive frames of a movie, we can think about how much the object moved over that period of time, and then use that with the framerate to get a good estimate of the instantaneous velocity.

  "body": " Position and Velocity     -----   ------   The formula that gives the average velocity, , is more important and more powerful than it might seem at first. We will only scratch the surface of what can be done with this idea in this section, but the big picture is that this is essentially the root of the mathematical field of calculus. All you need to do is add the idea of really small time intervals and do a bit of algebra, and you've developed the core ideas of differential calculus. Furthermore, if you rearrange the equation into the form , you are on the threshold of integral calculus.  Our approach will be very graphical and example-driven, and we'll leave it for the curious student to figure out how to generalize this and formally develop calculus for themselves.    Getting Velocity from Position  Usually when we think about the formula , we tend to be looking at problems where the data is given to us through words. \"A person rides their bike a distance of 45 km in 3 hours. Determine their velocity.\" The formula allows us to plug in numbers directly and get the correct answer of 15 km\/h. Our goal is to understand this process from a purely graphical perspective.  We will begin by thinking about what the position graph would look like given the data. We will have to make an assumption, such as treating the starting point of the ride as the origin. But once that's in place, our graph contains exactly two data points. When the position is , and when the position is . With this picture, the most basic way to interpolate the journey between the two data points is with a straight line. (Of course, we know it probably wasn't exactly like this, but we're not going to try to make this more complicated than it needs to be.)  GRAPH  Once we have this picture, we can start to look for where velocity might be found from the graph. And the big key comes from an important fact about lines. You might remember that you can determine the slope of a line using \"rise over run\", which is sometimes denoted . Those deltas should feel familiar, and if you look at how we've labeled our axes, you can see that slope and velocity are exactly the same thing. What this means is that the slope of the position graph gives us velocity. There's a bit of work required to formalize this (which is where calculus comes in), but it's mostly intuitive that with smooth-looking curves, we might think of the slope at a point as the slope of the tangent to the curve.  GRAPH  There are four basic ideas that we want to get from this:    Positive slopes correspond to forward movement.    Negative slopes correspond to backwards movement.    Steeper slopes correspond to faster movement.    Gentler slopes correspond to slower movement.    With these ideas in mind, we can look at the graph of the position of an object and also develop a sense of how that looks as an animation (so that you can see the velocities).   Interpreting Velocities from a Position Graph  DETAILS TO BE FILLED IN     Getting Position from Velocity  We now want to turn the situation around. Instead of starting with position, we're going to start with velocity. And the goal will be to create a graph of the position from this information. For simplicity, we will assume that the starting position of the object is .  The formula we will need is this: . The variable tells us how much the position in changing in the specific time interval. What this means is that if the object is at some position , then one frame later it will be at the position .  The main challenge we have is to figure out how to interpret the quantity geometrically. And the key observation is that multiplication is used to get the area of a rectangle. So we need to understand how we can get rectangles into the velocity graph so that we can translate the velocity curve into a position curve.  We will start with the simple example of an object moving with constant velocity. In this case, the velocity curve is just a horizontal line at height . Then for any , the quantity is the area of the rectangle whose height is and whose width is . Notice that this is the area under the graph over the time the interval.  The formula only applies when the velocity is constant. So what happens if we allow the velocity to change? For this, we will go back to the idea that if the value is small enough, then over any single time interval the velocity is essentially a constant. What this means is that instead of thinking about the velocity as a nice smooth curve, we will think of it more as a series of very short steps, where the velocity is constant along each of those steps. In a practical sense, we can imagine this corresponding to the framerate of a video.  SEE GRAPH  And how that we've got the velocity broken down into a bunch of rectangles, we can use the area of each rectangle to calculate the change of position for every frame. And then it would be the case that the total change of position would be the sum of the areas of all the rectangles. Another way of saying that is that the total change in position is the total area under the velocity curve.

  "title": "Acceleration",
  "body": " Acceleration     I think my acceleration is very good. That's the key for me.   Usain Bolt   The concept of velocity is that it is measuring how the position of an object changes over time. This idea sets us up the idea for how we can develop other physics concepts. Rather than asking how the position changes over time, we can ask about how the velocity is changing over time. This gives us the concept of acceleration.    Defining Acceleration   acceleration The formula that defines acceleration is , where is the change in the velocity and is the change in time. This mirrors the formula that defines velocity. The units of acceleration take a little bit of getting used to. Since the units of velocity are , the units of acceleration are .  It can be tempting to try to over-interpret these units. When you see it in the latter form, you might be tempted to try to understand what \"squared seconds\" are as a unit. But that unit is not a very sensible object to talk about because we don't ever really multiply time by itself. The reason we write it in the latter form is because it's more compact, but the \"more correct\" way to see it is the former way. It's measuring how velocity (which happens to be measured in units of ) changes over time.    Average and Instantaneous Acceleration   acceleration, average  acceleration, instantaneous Just as with velocity, the basic formula technically gives us average acceleration . This is because you still have to have a time interval over which you're measuring the change of velocity, and it's possible for nuances of the changes in velocity to get lost in that. Just as before, we can construct the idea of the instantaneous acceleration as the accelration at a specific moment in time, which runs into the same conundrum of there not being a single instant of time that is being observed. The basic resolution, as noted before, is to just take small enough time increments so that the change in velocity over that period of time is negligible.    Practically Measuring Acceleration  Acceleration is more a more complicated value, and it requires more information for us to determine it from positions. Let's imagine that we have a movie. If we look at any particular frame by itself, we won't be able to measure either velocity or acceleration. That single instant of time does not give us the information we need. If we were to look one frame later, would could see changes in the position, which would allow us to get the velocity. However, that is only a single velocity value. In order to see a change in velocity, we have to look at a third frame so that we can measure the velocity between frames the second two frames, and then see how that velocity is changing.   accelerometer While this multi-layered calculation is often required, we have other tools that measure acceleration. Such tools are known as accelerometers . There are digital devices that do this, but while those devices are great for data collection, they also hide all of the concepts inside of the circuitry, and so it's harder to understand what's happening. So we will think about the classic analog accelerometer. You should imagine a clear tube with a ball in the middle that is connected to the top and bottom of the tube by springs. If you hold the tube vertically and motionless for a while, the ball will eventually settle into what is known as the \"equilibrium position\", which is what gives us our reference point. If you lift the tube upward quickly, you should be able to intuitively see that the ball will initially shift downward relative to the tube. This is how it indicates an upward acceleration. Similarly, (after letting it reach equilirbrium again) if you lower the tube quickly, the ball will shift upward. This gives the basic idea for how these devices work.    The Experience of Acceleration  A lot of people have a misconception of acceleration. They often think that \"acceleration\" means \"fast.\" For example, \"a car with great acceleration goes fast.\" But this is the wrong way to think about it. Instead, it makes more sense to think about acceleration in terms of how we can experience it.  But before we can do that, we need to establish something about velocity. It turns out that we don't directly experience velocity. This may sound strange at first, since you have a lot of experiences of moving quickly and moving slowly, and you know the difference between them. The challenge of experiencing velocity is that we can only observe it visually. We look at things that are around us, and those things tell us whether we're moving. You might be sitting in a room and think that you are stationary, but in reality, you're sitting on a globe that's spinning. In fact, if you were at the equator, you would be traveling at around 1600 km\/hr. And if you zoom out a bit more, you're on a planet that is orbiting the sun at around 30 km\/s. But you don't experience any of that velocity because all you have as reference points are the objects around you, and they are on the same ride you are.  Acceleration, on the other hand, can be experienced directly. If you're in an accelerating vehicle, you will feel your body being pushed backwards slightly if you are speeding up, or you will feel your body being pushed forward if you are slowing down. You will also feel acceleration when riding an elevator, by feeling yourself being pushed down slightly if the elevator is accelerating upward and by feeling a little lighter if the elevator is accelerating downward. Notice that the feeling in the elevator is independent of whether the elevator is going up or down. All that matters is how the velocity is changing.    G-Force  A common unit for measuring acceleration in is in s, which is also called g-force. Even though it has \"force\" in the name, it's really an acceleration, but in a confusing twist of physics, it is very closely connected to forces and so the name really does make sense. (If you know about , then you might be ablet to make sense of the idea that g-force is force per unit of mass.)) The numerical value of is 9.8 m\/s , which is the conventional value for the acceleration on earth due to gravity alone. (It turns out that the true acceleration changes depending on where you are on the planet.)  G-forces are used to help give us a relative sense of how much acceleration something is experiencing. For example, it is known that the g-force on the moon is about 0.16 g. (This is not to be confused with 0.16 grams!) What this means is that you weigh about 16% (about 1\/6) of what you normally do. Alternatively, if you on the sufrace of the sun (and somehow not dead), the g-force is 28 g, and so it would be like you weigh 28 times heavier on there.  G-forces are also used to measure acceleration in other contexts. A stunt pilot might experience an acceleration of 9 g, which means that for that particular maneuver it's as if they weighed 9 times more with gravity pushing them in some direction based on how they are turning.

  "title": "Two-Dimensional Position Graphs",
  "body": " Two-Dimensional Position Graphs   Introduction  We saw how one-dimensional motion can be presented as a position graph with time as the horizontal axis and position as the vertical axis. But how do these ideas extend into more dimensions? It turns out that each dimension can have its own motion graphs, and that by properly aligning the motion in both dimensions, it's possible to create the desired movements. We will be using simple flip books as the medium to help us gain a deeper understanding of this process.    Equipment List    3x5 index cards (a pack of 100 will give you enough with plenty to spare)    Ruler    Scissors    Pencil      Procedure  The task will be broken into two phases. The first phase is to prepare the flipbook materials. The second phase is to create animations based on the given position graphs.    Since the animations we are drawing are going to be given by graphs, it will be important that each page of the flipbook is drawn consistently, otherwise the motion will not appear the way it should. In order to be consistent, it is helpful to create a template that you will use to create all of the pages of animations with.    Take an index card and lay it out so that the long direction is horizontal. Measure 3 cm in from the left side and draw a vertical line. This is just a margin for the binder clip, so it doesn't need to be perfect.    Measure 5 cm from the left edge and draw another vertical line. Try to get this line as close to vertical as possible. This will be the left edge of your frame. Do the same thing at 11 cm. This will be the right edge of your frame. (You may find it helpful to measure the distances at the top and bottom of the index card, and then use those two markings to get a good vertical line.)    Draw a horizontal line down the middle of the card. It doesn't need to be exactly in the middle, but you should try to make it as close to horizontal as possible. Measure 3 cm above and below this line at the left and right edges of the frame and connect those points to create a 6 cm by 6 cm square. This square is the entirety of your frame.    Carefully cut out the square. Make 1 cm markings all the way around the square. These will be your reference markings to help you determine the coordinates of the points in your frame. Label the markings from -3 to 3 left-to-right, and again bottom-to-top. In the end, you should have something that looks like this:   The animation template        Below are several pairs of graphs that represent the x and y positions of an object that you are going to animate. Try to think through the images and make a conjecture as to the final two-dimensional behavior of the object.    Animation #1:   Animation #1      Animation #2:   Animation #2      Animation #3:   Animation #3        For each pair of graphs above, note that you have be given a total number of frames of animation that you will need to make with it. You will need to draw the correct number of vertical lines to ensure that you traverse the animation with roughly equal time steps. An example is provided below. You can choose the shape of your object, but it is recommended to keep it simple (like a circle or a square). You will want to try to draw the object the same size every frame.      Sample Animation  Consider the following graphs:   The original graphs    The first step is to break the animation into 9 equally-spaced frames. We will denote these frames with vertical lines. Notice that in order to get 9 frames, you must have 8 spaces. Corresponding to each frame is an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. We have listed these under each marking.   Adding in marks for each frame    These coordinates give us the locations to draw our shape (a circle for this example), with each shape getting its own frame. All of the images are drawn together here just to save space. Also notice that frames 1 and 9 are in the same position. From this, we can see that this is the animation of an object moving around a rotated square.   A representation of the position of the circle on each frame      Discussion    What experiences have you had (before this lab) with making flipbooks animations? If you've made flipbooks, what are the similarities and differences between what you've done in the past and this lab?    Were you able to correctly anticipate the motion of the object? If so, what helped you make the correct prediction? If not, do you feel that your ability to understand the motion is better now that you have done a few of these?    Describe how you would do the reverse process. Suppose you knew what movement you wanted to see. How can you take that concept and then convert it into graphs of x and y positions?      Conclusion  For this lab, we focused on just the position of the object being animated. But this same concept can be applied to a much wider range of behaviors. For example, it's possible that one of the graphs will represent the rotation of the object or the angle of a joint. By stacking multiple layers of these graphs on top of an object, it's possible to create extremely nuanced behaviors.    Lab Write-Up Guidance  Use the following outline to help you write up your lab report completely and correctly.    Title and Header  What is the title of the lab and who was in the lab group?    Introduction  In your own words, what was the purpose of the lab activity? Explain how this topic is relevant to computer animation.    Procedure  Describe the process of making the template and drawing the animations.    Results and Data  Describe the results of the animations that you created from the graphs.

  "body": " One-Dimensional Motion with Constant Acceleration     -----   ------   In this section, we will be focusing on describing the kinematics objects when there is a constant acceleration. Before getting started, we are going to introduce some basic notation.     : The constant acceleration.     : Velocity as a function of time. This notation means that we will sometimes use a by itself, but you need to remember that this changes with time. If we need to explicitly indicate the time, we will use the second notation with being the specific value.     : Initial velocity. Notice that this notation means that we are using the velocity at time as the value of .     : Position as a function of time. This follows the same notation rules as velocity.     : Initial position.      The Constant Acceleration Equations  Here are the equations for position and velocity when the acceleration is constant:   These equations create the mathematical curves of a parabola and a line. This means that the underlying mathematics of these motions are not too complicated. In a regular physics course, we would spend a lot of time solving equations, but for this course our emphasis will be on building intuition that helps us to understand the motion instead of doing calculations.  In the special case that we're looking at the acceleration due to earth gravity, we use , where . Then the equations would look like this:   It is important to remember that these equations are for movement in just one dimension. If we are working in two dimensions, each dimension will have its own equations. (We will explore that scenario in the next section.)    Parabolas  We need to spend a little bit of time talking about the graph of a parabola because it is fundamentally important to kinematics. We will use the graph of an object being launched vertically from the ground as our basic model for discussing the parabola's central features.  The first observation of the parabola is the shape. Intuitively, it makes sense that if we launch something upward, it will eventually turn downward because of gravity. And the graph of the parabola matches this behavior. This shape is due to the negative sign on the term. If that term were positive, we would have an upward-opening parabola, and while this is perfectly meaningful mathematically, we do not have a lot of physics contexts where the parabola faces this way.   vertex (of a parabola)  axis of symmetry (of a parabola) The parabola has a point where the motion changes from going up to going down. That point is called the vertex of the parabola. This point also marks the axis of symmetry of the parabola, meaning that the shape of the parabola moving away from this point is the same in both directions. This means that if you were to watch an object in motion, you would not be able to tell whether time was going forward or backward based on the motion of the object alone. It looks exactly the same going up as it does going down with the time reversed.  If we were to drop an object from rest (without any initial velocity), we would get a half-parabola shape that starts from the vertex and falls down. The parabola from here has an interesting pattern. Suppose we picked a certain amount of time (such as 2 seconds) and measured how far it fell during that time. If we were to let it fall for twice the amount of time (4 seconds), it will have fallen four times the initial measurement. If we were to let it fall for three times the amount of time (6 seconds), it will have fallen nine times the initial measurement. This is the nature of the shape of a parabola.   "

  "title": "Projectile Motion",
  "body": " Projectile Motion     -----   ------   Projectile motion is the name of the behavior of objects in motion under the influence of a constant gravitational acceleration. The mechanism that starts everything into motion can be anything from a gun, to a baseball bat hitting a ball, to someone or something dropping an object. For projectile motion, we only care about what happens after the object is no longer under the influence of whatever it is that caused it to start moving.    The Projectile Motion Formulas  The formulas for projectile motion are an application of the constant acceleration formulas we had in the previous section. In the vertical direction, the constant acceleration is , where is the acceleration due to gravity. On earth, this is approximately . In the horizontal direction, there is no acceleration, so . Notice that this means that we are ignoring the effects of air resistance. When put together, this gives us the following pair of equations for projectile motion:   It may take some time to get used to the notation, but this is a standard way of writing it. This is what the symbols mean:     : This is the initial velocity in the horizontal direction.     : This is the initial horizontal position of the object. Typically, the origin is chosen so that this is zero, but not always.     : This is the initial velocity in the vertical direction. If an object is dropped from rest or from a horizontally-moving vehicle, then this value will be zero.     : This is the initial vertical position of the object. Most of the time, we take to be ground level.    We also have equations that give us the velocity in each direction.   Notice that this means that the horizontal velocity is a constant. This is a reflection of an idea known as \"Newton's First Law of Motion\", which we will explore in a later section.  The formulas above are completely general, but there is a special case that is worth independent investigation. This leads us to some additional formulas that are handy to have. However, it's important to remmeber that this is a special case, and the formulas only apply when the assumptions have been met. Failing to remember these conditions leads to errors.    Dropped Objects  We are often interested in the time it takes for a dropped object to hit the ground. Typically, this is done with the object at rest (not moving), which would mean that and . We will also assume that the initial position is and . Under these assumptions, we have the following equations of motion:   Ultimately, we are interested in when the object hits the ground, which is . We can plug this in and solve for :   We can also use this equation to determine the gravitational acceleration by dropping objects from various heights and measuring the time it takes for the object to hit the ground. We do this by solving for instead of .   In some cases, we don't assume that , such as when dropping an object from a moving vehicle (a car or a plane) or when throwing or launching an object horizontally. But this change does not affect the dynamics in the coordinate.    A Launched Object from the Origin  A common situation to consider is when an object is launched from the ground. We will assume that you know the initial horizontal and vertical velocities, but it's possible with a little bit of trigonometry to be able to determine these from the total speed and the angle of launch. We also typically take and , which means that we are launching from ground level and we're treating our launch position as the origin. With these substitutions, our equations become   Using a bit of algebra, we can combine these equations together to determine the range of flight, which is how far the objecet travels before it hits the ground. To do this, we set and solve for . We get and . The case is just our launch position, so we will focus on the other solution. This tells us that the object will be in the air until . We can also take this value and plug it into the formula for to find out how far it traveled, giving .  We can also use the time of flight to figure out how high the object the object went. The symmetrical shape of the parabola tells us that it will happen at the midpoint of flight, or at time . If we plug this into the formula for the position of the object, we get .  Incidentally, we can get the same result from the vertical velocity equation. At the instant the object reaches maximum height, its vertical velocity is switching from positive to negative, which means that the vertical velocity is zero. If we set the vertical velocity equation equal to zero, we get , and if we solve for , we get , matching the value we derived above.  To summarize, when , , we have the following results:    Time of flight:     Range of flight:     Maximum height of flight: at time     It's worth noting that in some cases, you will know the total initial speed of the object and the launch angle, and you will need to derive the initial horizontal and vertical speeds. This is a simple application of trigonometry. If we draw a right triangle with hypotenuse length and an angle relative to the horizontal, then our trigonometry relationships tell the horizontal length is and the vertical length is . In other words, we have ) and . You will often see the projectile motion formulas presented in this way.    Practical Realities  These formulas assume that we've removed the effect of air resistance. But it's worth thinking about what would happen if we looked at more realistic physics that takes air resistance into account.  The first observation to make is that objects are not likely to go as high or as far. The reason is that the air resistance will tend to slow down the motion of the projectile. You can see this in practice by throwing a crumpled piece of paper. Unless the paper is wadded up very tightly, it will not go as far as you would expect when you throw it.   terminal velocity Another feature of adding air resistance is that there is a terminal velocity for falling objects. In the acceleration model we developed, there's no limit to how fast something falls. However, the reality is that moving through the air will cause objects to reach a maximum speed when falling. Conceptually, you can think of this being the result of the object having to push air molecules out of the way, which takes away from the speed that it can attain.

In this section, we're going to look at gravity in more general terms, which will lead to a variable gravitational acceleration.    Universal Gravity   Newton, Sir Isaac Here is a name you need to know: Sir Isaac Newton . He could rightly be considered the first real physicist, and his name is on a wide range of physics concepts (including the laws of physics, which gives you a true sense of his importance to the field). Although a lot of work was done on the topic of gravity before he came along, he was the first to formalize it and give it its universal interpretation.   Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation  Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation   Each particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is proportional to the their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.    Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation phrases the ideas in terms of the \"force\" between objects, but we haven't talked about what that means. So we're going to modify the statement slightly so that it is framed in terms of acceleration. It should be noted that this formulation, while perfectly consistent with Newton's ideas, usually does not appear as a separate concept like we are doing here.   Newton's Law of Universal Gravitational Acceleration  Newton's Law of Universal Gravitational Acceleration   Each particle in the universe causes every other particle in the universe to accelerate towards it with an acceleration that is proportional to the first particle's mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.     gravitational constant From the phrasing of the relationship, we can see that the formula for acceleration is the following: where is the constant of proportionality, is the mass of the object causing the acceleration, and is the distance between the two objects. The constant of proportionality is called the gravitational constant . Although Newton described this constant in 1687, it wasn't directly measured until Henry Cavendish did it in 1798. The modern accepted value for this is . (Recall that the unit represents Newtons and has units of .)    Earth Acceleration  Using Newton's Law of Universal Acceleration, we can calculate the acceleration of gravity on earth. The mass of the earth is approimately and its radius is approximately 6378 km, or . These values can be plugged directly into the formula to get the acceleration due to gravity on earth.   This value closely matches the value we used in the previous section.

  "body": " Moon Physics   Introduction  A common conspiracy theory is that we didn't land on the moon, and that all of the footage was done in a studio. We are going to look at one theorized aspect of the footage, which is that the moon gravity was faked by filming at a high frame rate and slowing it down to give the appearance of a low gravity environment. We are going to perform a practical test of this theory to see whether the time-slowing physics matches with the theory of low gravity physics.    Equipment List    Video camera capable of slow motion video (cellphones can work)    Meter stick    Marble      Procedure  We are going to test the conspiracy theory by directly filming with a high framerate and then adjusting the timing to try to match the altered gravity. Then we will examine the details of the behavior to see whether the underlying physics remains consistent.    Film a marble being dropped from a height of one meter and landing on the floor in slow motion. Do this in front of the meter stick so that you will be able to take measurements. It may be helpful to film this a few times to ensure that you have good video to work with.    Calculate the time it should take the marble to fall 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, ..., 100 cm under moon gravity. Organize this information into a chart.    Using the time it should take an object to fall 100 cm (1 m), determine the appropriate framerate that the video should be running at in order to mimic moon gravity. (Note: You will need to know the total number of frames required for the object to fall.) Adjust the video framerate accordingly.    Using the adjusted video, determine the amount of time it took for the marble fall 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, ..., 100 cm. Organize this information into a chart.    Film 10-15 seconds of walking around and jumping in slow motion. This video will be used later.

Watch the moon gravity version of the video. How \"real\" does it look to you?    How well did the moon gravity video align with the theoretical values? Is this difference enough to be noticable in this situation?    Adjust the framerate of the video of your movement to match moon gravity. Does this look like you're on the moon? What do you notice about the video that leads you to your conclusion? What changes would you have to make in order to make it more convincing (aside from costumes and props).      Conclusion  There are lots of technical reasons that the moon landing could not have been faked using the available technology of the time. But setting those aside and just thinking about trying to make the videos, you can see from this lab that the challenges are not all solved by simply adjusting the frame rate.

  "body": " Newton's First Law of Motion     -----   ------   The Greeks viewed the world as being made of four fundamental elements, and each of these elements had a \"natural state\" where those elements wanted to be. For example, rocks fell because they wanted to return to the earth. However, Newton's First Law of Motion rejected such philosophical musings and replaced them with with a concrete rule that applied to all objects and all situations.    The Idea of Newton's First Law: Inertia    An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by a net force.     inertia  mass The basic idea is simple. Objects don't just move arbitrarily. They move because something caused them to move. And if they are in motion, they will maintain that motion until something causes the motion to change. The tendency of objects to resist changing their motion (or lack of motion) is called inertia . The amount of inertia an object has is known as its mass . It's very important to remember that mass and weight are not the same concept. Even in the weightlessness of outer space, objects will still have mass and will still resist your attempts to change their motion.    Forces and Free Body Diagrams   force Newton's concept of inertia includes a clause that allows the motion of objects to change, which is through the use of a force . Forces are understood as an influence (such as a push or a pull) that can cause an object to change its motion. Forces can have all sorts of sources. Forces can be caused by gravity, magnetism, or the physical interaction of objects. At this stage, we aren't interested in what causes the forces. All we need to do is focus on the idea that they exist and they can cause changes to motion.  Forces are vectors. This means that they have a direction and a magnitude. So when we think about how a force might be interacting with an object, we have to pay attention to the direction of the force. This will tell us whether the force is causing the object to speed up, slow down, or change directions (or some combination of those). The direction of the force is the direction that the object would start to move if it was at rest.   free body diagram  net force When thinking about the forces that are being applied to an object, we often draw a picture known as a free body diagram . This is a picture that represents the object and all of the forces that are being applied to it. This helps us to organize the information in a problem. Since forces are vectors, they can be added together. The net force is the result of adding together all of the forces that are acting on an object. If an object is maintaining its motion, then the net force must be zero.  We will explore these diagrams in more detail in a later section.   "

  "title": "Newton’s Second Law of Motion",
  "body": " Newton's Second Law of Motion     -----   ------   Newton's Second Law of Motion is, in a certain sense, an elaboration on the First Law. The First Law tells us when an objections motion will change, and the Second Law tells us how it will change.    The Idea of Newton's Second Law: Calculating Acceleration    The net force on an object at any instant of time is equal to the product of its mass and its acceleration.    Newton's Second Law of Motion gives us the famous equation . The on the left side of the equation is the net force, which is the sum of all of the forces that are acting on the object. The on the right side of the equation is the acceleration vector, which tells us how the velocity is changing, which in turn can tell us how the position of the object is changing. This equation represents all of the interactions that we can observe, whether it's ropes, springs, magnets, gravity, or something else.    Momentum   momentum An important concept that is related to Newton's Second Law of Motion is momentum . Mathematically, momentum is calculated using the formula (where and are both vectors). Conceptually, momentum can be interpreted the quantity created when there is a mass that is in motion. However, it is difficult to interpret exactly what this quantity is. One interpretation of it is that it's a measure of how hard it would be to bring an object to rest. Objects with more momentum require more \"effort\" to make it stop than objects with less momentum. This does not fully capture all of the nuances of momentum, but it's close enough for us.   impulse We can view Newton's Second Law of Motion through the lens of momentum. Instead of thinking about the acceleration of an object, we can think about how its momentum is changing. A net force applied for a period of time will lead to a change of that object's momentum, and that force applied over a time is called an impulse .  Momentum is a deep enough topic that it will be given its own section.   "

  "body": " Newton's Third Law of Motion     -----   ------   ...    The Idea of Newton's Third Law: Balance    Whenever two objects interact with each other, they apply forces to each other that are equal in magnitude and in opposite directions. More commonly, this is stated in the following form: \"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\"    Newton's Third Law of Motion creates a sense of balance in the universe. If you push on an wall, the wall also pushes you. The universe does not give one object preference over another. Another way to think about this is that interaction forces always come in pairs. Any time one object applies a force to another, there's an equal and opposite force being applied back to it. This concept may seem simple, but it's not always intuitive. We will look at a few examples of this law in action.    Movement  Moving around is one of the simplest things we can do, but it's interesting to think deeply about the physics of it. Let's start by thinking about walking. How is it that you are able to move forward when you walk? You push backwards against the ground, and the ground pushes you forward. This may seem strange at first. How does the ground push you forward? The underlying force is friction, and if you've ever tried to walk on a surface that has less friction (such as ice), then you've experienced what it's like to not have the ground's help when trying to move forward.  If we switched from walking to swimming, the same idea applies. The reason that you are able to swim forward is because you are pushing backwards on the water and the water is pushing you forward. But what if we pushed this idea further? What if we were trying to swim in space? Based on this logic, since there's nothing for you to push backwards on, there's no way that you will be able to move forward.  But then how is it that rockets can go forward in space? This is also by using Newton's Third Law, but in a different way. For movement on earth and in water, we are relying on friction with the world around us to give us that forward push. Rockets work on a different principle. Rather than relying on objects in the environment to push off of, rockets bring those objects with it in the form of fuel. As the fuel gets pushed backwards, the rocket gets pushed forward.    Flying Birds in a Truck  This is a classic physics thought experiment: Does a truck full of birds weigh less if birds are flying?  One side of the argument is that since the birds are flying, they aren't really attached to the truck, and so their weight won't be measured and the truck is lighter. Think about jumping off a scale. When you're in the air, the scale won't read your weight. And the same works with the birds. At least, that's how the argument goes.  This turns out to be wrong because of Newton's Third Law. The comparison with jumping isn't accurate because a jump is a type of falling. If all of the birds simultaneously stopped flapping and just fell to the floor, then there would be a temporary instant when then truck is lighter. But assuming that the birds are actually flying, we have to understand how it is that they're flying. They fly because they are exerting a downward force on the air in the truck. That air is pushing down on the truck, and so the weight of the birds is transferred to the truck through the air.  This thought experiment has actually been tested with a real truck and real birds (Mythbusters, Season 5, Episode 9) as well as with drones (which are easier to work with than birds). They all verify that Newton's Third Law and show that there is no change in the weight when the birds are in flight.   "

  "body": " Forces     Use the Force, Luke.   Obi-Wan Kenobi (Star Wars: A New Hope)   We will now start to put Newton's Laws of Motion into practice. We will consider the motion of objects under the influence of various forces, and think about their corresponding free body diagrams. By understanding these diagrams, we will have a deeper understanding of one of the core tools used to analyze physical situations.    Gravity  We have already discussed the acceleration of an object caused by gravitational attraction. From Newton's Second Law of Motion, we know that the force is the product of the object's mass and its acceleration, so that the force of gravity can be written as , where is the acceleration from gravity for the problem (earth gravity is ).  The free body diagram for this on its own is just a single arrow pointing doward, indicating the force of gravity on the object. As it stands, this object is experiencing a net force, and so it is accelerating downward. If there's nothing to apply an upward force, the object will continue to accelerate, causing it to fall faster and faster.    Air Resistance  We are going to add some air resistance to the gravity example. Now as the object is falling, it's also experiencing air resistance. This can be thought of as the impact of the object bumping into molecules of as it falls. As it falls faster, it bumps into more air, and so it experiences more resistance.  The free body diagram now has two forces. Gravity is still pulling it downward, but now there's also an upward force that we can call . The size of this force will depend on a number of factors, such as the weight and shape of the object. An object that is more streamline in the direction of motion will hit fewer air molecules than something that is bulky in that direction. But regardless of the shape, there is some amount of upward force from the air.   terminal velocity There is a specific when the force of gravity perfectly matches the force of air resistance. This is known as terminal velocity . When an object is falling at terminal velocity, there is zero net force on the object because the two forces are perfectly cancelling each other out. This means that there is no acceleration, which means that the object's motion is unchanging (Newton's First Law), and the object will remain at this velocity until something changes.    Normal Forces  One of the most challenging types of forces to understand is the normal force . This is the force that an object imparts on another object when they interact with each other. This force is always viewed as being perpendicular to the surface.(\"Normal\" is a mathematical term for perpendicularity.) Such forces always exist whenever two objects are physically interacting with each other.  Consider a ball sitting on a table. If we tried to apply Newton's First Law, we would see an object at rest that is staying at rest, and so we know that there is no net force acting on it. However, since this ball is subject to gravity, and gravity is a downward force, in our force diagram we must have a downward arrow to represent that. If this were the only force acting on the ball, then the ball would start to accelerate towards the ground. But the ball is at rest, and that's because the table is applying an upward force to the ball. And since the ball is at rest, the upward force of the table must be exactly equal to the downard force of gravity.  We can also see how this normal force works to create motion. Instead of thinking of the ball on a table, let's think about it on an incline. Remember that the normal force is always perpendicular to the surface, so that the incline does not apply a vertical force to the ball. When we draw the force diagram, we will have gravity pulling the ball downward, but then the normal force would push up at an angle. Notice that the angle of the normal force indicates which direction (left or right) the ball is going to roll. In fact, we can know that the net force the ball is going to experience must be parallel to the incline because that's the ultimate direction the ball will move. From this, we can do a vector analysis to determine exactly how large the normal force must be.    Surface Friction   friction Friction is the force that resists the relative movement of objects sliding against each other. Friction can occur between many types of objects: solid objects against other solid objects, solid objects against a fluid (such as air or water resistance), and a fluid against itself are just some of the ways friction can be manifested.   kinetic friction  static friction We are going to focus our attention on the friction between solid objects, which is known as surface friction . But even this isn't quite an entirely simple concept, because there are two types of friction. There's static friction , which is the friction between two objects when there is no movement between them, and then there's kinetic friction , which is the friction between two objects when they are moving relative to each other.   coefficient of static friction The formula for the force of friction between two objects at rest relative to each other is , where is the magnitude of the normal force and is the coefficient of static friction , whose value depends on the two surfaces that are in contact with each other. The direction of the friction force is always opposite of the direction that resists movement. Smaller values of mean that there is less friction, with 0 being no friction at all. The reason that the force is given as an inequality is that the quantity on the right represents the maximum amount of friction that can exist between the two surfaces.   coefficient of kinetic friction The coefficient of kinetic friction (denoted ) plays the same role as the coefficient of static friction, except it applies when the two objects are sliding past each other. The coefficient of kinetic friction is always smaller than the coefficient of static friction for the same pair of objects. You have experienced this if you have ever tried to move something heavy. It takes a certain amount of effort to get it moving, and once it's moving it takes less effort to keep it moving. In this case, the formula is , and this is an equality because in this situation the friction is always at its maximal value. If the movement of the object slows down to the point that it is no longer moving, then we would be back in the case of static friction.   "

It's impossible to move the cloth away from the dishes without exerting any force, so there will always be some movement. This means that the challenge is to try to control that force as much as possible to minimize the acceleration of the dishes.  There will always be at least two forces acting on the dishes. There will always be gravity pulling the dishes downward, and there will be a friction force that opposes the cloth from sliding out from under the dishes. In some cases, there may be an additional force between the fabric and the dishes, depending on the angle that the fabric is making with the table.

Then you will have a chance to practice the technique before we start adjusting the parameters.    Mark a spot 20 cm from one of the edges with the fabric chalk or a small piece of tape. Be sure that the edge does not have a hem, otherwise the trick will become far more difficult to complete successfully. Make another mark about 40 cm from the same edge. Each time you do the experiment, you will be placing an object at the 10 cm mark and have the tablecloth so that the edge of the table is at the 40 cm mark. This will help with the consistency of the observations.    One of the techniques that people try to use for this trick is to pull the cloth towards their body. This will almost always fail. Record yourself doing this (using slow motion), making sure to focus your attention on the glass and the tablecloth near the cup. Watch the footage of the instant the tablecloth starts to move near the cup. Make some observations about what you see and why this is not a good technique.    The correct technique is to pull the cloth downward, against the edge of the table. But even then, you need to be careful. Some people hold their hands up above the height of the table before pulling down. Record yourself doing this a couple times (in slow motion). Watch the footage of the instant the table cloth starts to move near the cup. Watch the footage of the instant the tablecloth starts to move near the cup. Make some observations about what you see and why this is not a good technique.    Set up the dishes again. Record yourself pulling downward slowly on the cloth. You should be going slowly enough that the cup does not slide. Think about what is happening with the friction when the cloth is being pulled slowly, and why it is necessary to do this very quickly.    Attempt the trick several times. Make notes of your successes and failures. (It is possible to be successful with some of the dishes while failing with others.)    Do the trick again, but this time add some weights to the cup and\/or dishes. Try this experiment again a few times. Does this seem easier or harder to do? Record yourself and make observations about the movement of the cup that can help explain what's happening.      Discussion      Explain why pulling the tablecloth towards your body does not work. You may find it helpful to draw a schematic diagram of the tablecloth and the dishes at the moment the tablecloth near the dishes starts to move.    Explain the observations that you made when you held your hands above the table before pulling downward. Specifically, discuss the interaction between the fabric and the cup, and how this interaction leads to problems.    Which objects were the most difficult to do the trick with? What reasons do you think this is the case?    Explain the result of adding weights to the dishes. What physical principle is in play that changes the result?      Conclusion  This parlor trick has some interesting physics embedded in it. Hopefully, you were able to appreciate and understand that better based on your experiences with it.

  "title": "Definining Energy",
  "body": " Definining Energy     It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is.   Richard Feynman (The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Volume 1, Chapter 4)   The idea of energy in physics can be a little bit slippery in a couple ways. The first is that we don't really have an idea of what energy really is. Yes, we have some intuitive concepts that can help us understand certain types of energy, but the energy itself isn't a specific thing, like an atom or a photon. It is a quantity that we can calculate and measure in various situations.  The second way that energy can be slippery is that it turns out that we don't necessarily have all of the formulas we need to account for it. We will see later that when objects collide and stick together, there is energy that is \"lost\" in the interaction. But the energy isn't lost in the sense that we don't know where it is. Instead, it's lost in the sense that we vaguely know what happened to it, but we have no way of accounting for exactly where it went. We can know how much energy there is that's unaccounted for, but we can't say exactly how much of it is in its various potential forms.  If this feels a little bit confusing, it's okay. Just reread the Feynman quote at the top, and keep moving forward.    A Loose Definition of Energy  If you look at different physics textbooks, you will find that they treat the definition of energy differently. Many textbooks don't even bother trying to come up with a definition of it, and just start using the word as if you already know what they mean. Other textbooks provide a definition, but then they gloss over the details when they violate that definition. Again, physicists don't actually know what energy is, which makes defining it a perilous task.  Here is the idea that we are going to use for this book:   energy    Energy is the ability to do work.    This is a nice concise definition. But what is work? And when can we do it? Here's where we're getting into the weeds of some really interesting (but really complicated) ideas. If you tried to look up \"work\" in a physics textbook, the definition that you will often is that it is a force applied over a distance. (Other textbooks define work as a mathematical formula, which isn't as helpful if you're trying to understand it.) This idea doesn't take into account that there are forms of energy (ultimately, heat) that can't be used to apply a force in any practical sense.  As a practical example, if you clap your hands together, you generate both sound and heat. But the sound doesn't last long, and neither does the heat. That energy still exists somewhere in the universe, but there's no way for you to harness it to do anything useful. This is the sort of difficulty that arises when talking about energy. We will have a discussion about work in another section.    Forms of Energy  The two primary forms of energy we will be looking at in this book are kinetic and potential energy. Here are some simplified definitions:     kinetic energy Kinetic energy is the energy of a moving object.     potential energy Potential energy is a form of stored energy within an object (or by virtue of its position relative to other objects) that can be converted to other forms of energy.    Even at this level, our definitions aren't great. For example, a very hot metal rod has a lot of kinetic energy because the metal ions are vibrating very quickly. But those vibrations are also a form of potential energy because we can use that energy to cause water molecules to move around, which leads to the creation of steam, which can move a turbine, which can be used to generate electricity. So it can also be seen as a type of potential energy. So we are once again playing with loose definitions, and we will quickly move to tangible examples.  All moving objects have kinetic energy. The amount of energy depends on how much mass it has, and how fast it's moving. Intuitively, fast moving objects have more energy than slow moving objects of the same mass. And more massive objects have more energy than small objects when moving at the same speed. For our purposes, we will only calculate the kinetic energy of massive objects, and not think about the kinetic energy of the individual molecules that an object is made of.  Potential energy can come in many forms. There is gravitational potential energy, which results from an object being held at a height. The potential energy can be converted to kinetic energy by letting it go, which will cause the object to fall. Potential energy can also be stored in an object itself, such as with a rubber band that has been stretched out. Once again, letting it go will cause it to move, and that movement is the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy.  In a certain sense, the two examples of potential energy here are mechanical forms of potential energy. There is something in the position of the object as a whole that is storing up the energy. But there are still other forms of potential energy. Chemical potential energy is usually thought of as the energy stored in chemical bonds (which to some people would be considered a form of mechanical potential energy, but not for this class). Nuclear potential energy is the energy stored in the nucleus of atoms (and there is a lot of energy stored there).  And there are still other forms of energy. Heat energy (or thermal energy), which is actually a form of kinetic energy but at the scale of individual atoms is one that we've briefly discussed. There's radiant energy, which is the energy found in protons (which is kind of like a kinetic energy, because it's the energy of a photon that's moving, but also not quite (though technically, probably yes)). There's also energy inherent to mass (which is related to the famous Einstein equation ).  Hopefully, this section created at least a little confusion in you, because the universe is a confusing place at times. If there is anything to take away from this section beyond some basic intuitions about how we deal with energy in physics, it's that simple answers in physics are usually only partially correct, at best.

  "title": "Defining Work",
  "body": " Defining Work     -----   -----   The somewhat convoluted explanation of the concept of energy in the previous section can mask the relative simplicity of the loose definition we had: \"Energy is the ability to do work.\" The time has now come to make a mess out of the concept of work.    A Definition of Work  We had said before that some textbooks use the idea that work is a force applied over a distance. But that definition, while very useful, isn't the one that we are going to use. It's a little bit too narrow for our applications. Here is our definition:   work    Work is the transfer of energy from one object or system of objects to another object or system of objects.    When we think about work, we will be thinking about it purely in terms of energy. It doesn't really matter what type of energy it is. It's just energy being transferred from one object to another. This definition is broad enough to encompass a wide range of situations.  If we lift an object from a low place to a high place, we are doing work by transferring energy from us to the the box. We won't try to describe the energy inside of us (it's a complicated chemical energy thing), but it should make intuitive sense that we expended some energy to lift the box up. The energy that the box gained is in the form of potential energy, because if we were to let it go, it would convert that potential energy into kinetic energy. But it's not quite that simple.  The reason that the box has potential energy is not because of something inherent to the box, but because of the physical distance between the box and the earth. This is why we need to include the idea of a system of objects. So when we lift the box up, we are adding energy to the system that contains both the box and the earth. If we then let go of the box, the earth-box system is converting that gravitational potential energy into the box's kinetic energy.  Here's another example: Suppose we have a ball rolling on a smooth, horizontal surface. The ball has kinetic energy. But eventually, the ball will stop rolling. Where did the energy go? There's some amount of friction between the ball and the surface, and that friction slows the rotation of the ball. So we might say that the ball is doing work on the surface. What would the energy transfer be? It would be the kinetic energy of the ball converting to heat energy in the surface, as friction generates heat.  But this wouldn't be a full accounting of the energy. The ball is also pushing through the air, and so some of the kinetic energy of the ball is being converted to the kinetic energy of the air (and also the potential energy, as some of the air molecules probably went upward). There's also the vibration of air due to the sound that the rolling ball makes, which is still another form of kinetic energy. A simple way to say all of this is to say that the ball is doing work on the environment, and the environment is the system of objects that consists of the general space and stuff around an object.

  "title": "Conservation of Energy",
  "body": " Conservation of Energy     -----   -----     The Principle of Conservation of Energy   work   In a closed system, energy is conserved.    A closed system is an environment where it is impossible for matter or energy to enter or leave. Sometimes, it's thought of as a universe-in-a-box. In practice, there is no such thing as a closed system other than the entire universe itself. However, this is a great conceptual tool that allows us to eliminate distractions and focus on just the ideas that we are interested in thinking about.  At a certain level, the conservation of energy is just a definition. The reason that energy is conserved is because we've declared that energy can't leave the system. In fact, there are models of physics where energy is not conserved. This gets really complicated because you have to get very technical with the definition of energy (which we've already seen is somewhat elusive) and you need to have a technical understanding of what it means to be conserved. Ultimately, we need to remember that we're just creating models and not declaring truths about the universe.    The Work-Energy Theorem  The work-energy theorem is a particular representation of the principle of conservation of energy. Here is how it is stated:   work   The net work done on a particle is equal to the change of the kinetic energy of that particle. As a formula, it is written as   where is the net work done on the particle and is the change in kinetic energy.    The assumption of the work-energy theorem is that all of the energy went into changing the kinetic energy of the object. This theorem is particularly useful for solving problems where the net work is challenging to calculate directly, which is actually a very broad range of interactions.  A basic example of this is determining the work done by a golf club striking a golf ball. Let's say that, after being struck by the club, the ball has a speed of 40 meters per second. If we wanted to calculate the work done by the club directly, we would have to come up with some sort of model of how the club and ball interact. It would need to involve details such as how fast the club head was moving, how long the club and ball were in contact with each other. Instead, we can just look at the the initial and final states, and skip over all of the details of the interaction.   "

  "title": "Energy Formulas",
  "body": " Energy Formulas     -----   -----   This discussion of energy would be incomplete without discussing at least a few of the formulas for energy.    Kinetic Energy  As mentioned previously, kinetic energy is the energy of objects in motion. Remember that we don't really know what energy is, we just know that objects in motion have it. There are some peculiarities about this framework that are worth considering.  Suppose you are riding a moving train and holding a ball in your hand. From your point of view, the ball has no kinetic energy because it appears to be stationary relative to you. However, if a person is standing on the ground as the train goes by, they will measure the ball moving at the speed that the train is moving, and they will determine that the ball has some kinetic energy. Who is correct?  They are both correct, at least from their own points of view. This only adds to the mystery of energy, because it suggests that kinetic energy isn't something that the object actually has. It's a number that we ascribe to the object, and it depends on how we perceive its motion.  The formula for kinetic energy is , where is the mass of the object and is its velocity. Using SI units, kinetic energy is measured in . This is a derived unit known as Joules (J).    Grivational Potential Energy  Gravitational potential energy is the energy stored in an object by moving it to a different height while under the influence of gravity. It makes sense that objects that are higher up have more potential energy that objects that are lower, and this is reflected in the formula for potential energy: , where is the mass of the object, is the acceleration due to gravity, and is the height. Notice that the units here are , which are the exact same units as kinetic energy. This makes sense since energy is energy, but it's not immediately clear from the formula that it works out that way.  Similarly to kinetic energy, this value will depend on how you measure it. If you are on the top floor of a building, the height at which you are holding an object will seem to you to be relative to the floor. But to someone on the ground floor will say that the object is much higher up. Even more confusingly, a person on the top floor of a taller building will say that the height of the object is negative, which means that the object can be seen as having a negative energy.  The reason that the physics still works out correctly is that we basically never talk about the absolute amount of gravitational potential energy an object has. In any practical setting, we only care about the change in that potential energy. So if an object falls a distance of 3 meters, it doesn't matter whose perspective you're taking because both people will measure the same change in height.  An even more confusing aspect of this idea is that it allows for negative potential energies. A person in a taller building might measure the height of the ball to be negative. If you plug in a negative value of into the formula, the energy is negative. And this fact still doesn't change how the physics works out because as the ball falls, its energy simply gets more negative.    Elastic Potential Energy   natural length (spring) Elastic potential energy is the potential energy stored in a spring that has either been compressed or stretched from its natural length (which is the length of the spring when it's just left alone). The formula for elastic potential energy for basic springs is , where is known as the spring constant and is the change in length from the natural length. The spring constant is a value that basically measures the stiffness of the spring. When the spring constant is large, it requires a lot of effort to stretch or compress it.  Springs can be an entire chapter on their own due to the fact that we can use springs as a model for a range of behaviors in physics. We are going to look at just a small piece of the picture. Imagine that you have a spring with one end attached to the ceiling and the other end hanging downward. Now imagine putting a small weight on the end of the spring, pulling it downward a bit, and then letting it go. What do you think is going to happen?   simple harmonic oscillation You should be anticipating that the weight will bounce up and down. But if we ignore friction and look more closely, what we will see is energy conservation in action. As the spring reaches its shortest and longest lengths, the mass is coming to a rest, leading to there being no kinetic energy. At those moments, all of the energy is stored up in the spring as potential energy. As the spring starts to move back towards its equilibrium length, the mass picks up speed and the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. And this back-and-forth behavior is known as simple harmonic osciallation, and it will continue forever because we are ignoring friction.

  "title": "Gravity-Powered Projectile Launcher",
  "body": " Gravity-Powered Projectile Launcher   Introduction  For this lab, you are going to make a gravity-powered projectile launcher in order to study energy conservation and projectile motion. This lab will be a combination of practical construction and theoretical calculation.  To use the launcher, place the marble inside of the elbow of the swinging arm and raise the arm at an angle. Note that you will have to use your fingers to keep the marble in place as you do this. When you release the arm, the marble should stay in the elbow until the arm hits the stopper, at which point the marble should launch forward and fall to the ground.  We will be manipulating two primary variables for this lab: launcher height and marble height. The launcher height is measured from the ground to the bottom of the piece of wood, which is also the same as the top of the table it is placed on. The marble height is how far above the table the marble is when it is let go. Measuring this value will require practice, as the marble is not always visible (and making it visible can lead to inconsistent results). This is where the practice will come in. (A third variable that will be manipulated is the direction that the launcher is facing, but we won't be trying to control for this.)  The outcome variable will be the horizontal distance from the front edge of the wood to the place where the marble first hits the ground. It is convenient to align the edge of the wood with the edge of the table to make this a little easier to measure. You can use some string and a weight if you wanted to be very precise about transferring the edge of the table to the floor. You might even mark it with a piece of tape to make it eaiser.    Equipment List    Meter stick    Calculator    Marble    1 meter of 1\/2\" PVC    3 90-degree 1\/2\" PVC elbows    PVC Cutter    Hot glue gun (or a drill and screws)    30 cm piece 2x4 (or other scrap wood)    Table and chair to launch from      Procedure  There are two parts to the procedure. The first part is to build the gravity launcher. The second part is to learn how to use it.    Mark and cut your 1-meter PVC into the following lengths: 29 cm, 29 cm, 25 cm, 7 cm, and the remainder. The remainder is theoretically 10 cm in length, but this one is the least relevant length. The launcher will be workable with a piece as short as 8 cm, though you should have one that is at least 9 cm.    Dry fit the launcher according the schematic that has been provided. When you're finished, the arm should swing freely until it hits the stopper, and the stopper cause the arm to stop in the vertical position (hitting the \"inner elbow\").    Once you are satisfied the construction of the launcher, glue at the indicated locations.    Measure the following distances. Note that these are going to be adjusting factors to help align the measured results with theoretical results, so it is important to be as accurate as possible.   The distance from the front edge of the wood to the middle of the vertical pieces.    The distance from the bottom of the wood to the height of the marble if the marble is at rest in launcher and the launcher is vertical.       Measure the height of the chair. (Measure to the surface on which the launcher will be placed.) Then place your launcher on the table.    Raise the arm until the marble height is 10 cm. Then release and measure the launch distance. Do this until you start to get a consistent result. Then repeat this at a height of 20 cm. (This step is just getting a feel for the launcher before we begin to systematically collect data.)    Collect data for the launch distance for the following marble heights: 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm, 20 cm, 25 cm, 30 cm. For each launch height, take 5 measurements and then compute the average. (Note: If you are using a 2x4)    Repeat the measurements, but this time using the table instead of the chair.      Sample Charts   Launch distance    Arm Height  5 cm  10 cm  15 cm  20 cm  25 cm  30 cm    Launch #1    Launch #2    Launch #3    Launch #4    Launch #5    Average       Discussion    The gravity launcher converts gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy. Explain why it should be the change in potential energy from the start and end of the launch should be equal to the kinetic energy of the marble.    From the previous question, it should be the case that , where is the mass of the marble, is the gravitational acceleration, is the change in height of the marble between the start and end of the launch, and is the velocity of the marble at the moment of launch. If we solve for from this equation, we get . Notice that there is no in this formula. What does this mean?    We saw from the formulas for projectile motion that an object launched horizontally from a height will hit the ground at time . We also know that the horizontal speed will be constant throughout (ignoring gravity), so we can use the value of from the previous problem. The horizontal distance traveled before it hits the ground is . Notice that there is no in this formula. What does this mean? (Hint: What if you did this experiment on the moon?)    Using the marble heights and chair\/table heights, calculate the theoretical distances that the marble should travel and compare that with the averages you obtained. They should not match up well. Explain why this is the case. (Hint: These errors would exist without human error. There is something systematically wrong.)    Use the adjusting values you obtained after building your launcher to correct the values of and , then try the formula again. How close are the values now?    What other possible sources of error are there in the launcher?      Conclusion  This is one of the more advanced labs of the course, due to the fact that it combines multiple concepts (energy conservation and projectile motion) in a framework that has a lot of potential for error. However, for many students it is also one of the most satisfying labs if you're able to make it all come together in the end. Theoretically, you should be able to place a container on the floor and consistent make the marble land in it with a device like this.

  "title": "Definining Momentum",
  "body": " Definining Momentum     -----   ------   Momentum is a property of objects in motion. In a sense, it measures \"how much\" movement there is. One way that people think about momentum is to ask the following question: \"How much will this hurt if it hits me?\"  It is easiest to understand by thinking about comparisons between similar situations. Suppose you have two identical objects, where one is moving slowly and the other is moving quickly. The fast-moving object has \"more\" movement than the slow-moving object, and so that one has more momentum. But now consider a tiny object and a massive object that are moving at the same speed. Even though the speeds are the same, there's still \"more\" movement in the large object than the smaller one. And so we can see that the idea of momentum involves both the mass and the velocity.  There are two types of momentum: linear momentum and angular momentum. We will introduce both, but our focusing will be on linear momentum. Unless otherwise noted, when you see momentum in this book, it will be referring linear momentum.    Linear Momentum   linear momentum   The linear momentum of an object the product of the mass of the object and its velocity vector.    Notice from the definition that increasing either mass or velocity will increase the momentum of an object. This matches with the discussion at the start of the section. Since momentum is the product of a scalar and a vector, it is a vector quantity. This isn't as important to think about when we are working in just one direction, but it becomes essential to understand when we are working in higher dimensions.  The momentum is calculated relative to a frame of reference, which is important because the measured velocity of an object depends on who is doing the measurement. This goes back to thinking about how the world is perceived by someone on the ground compared to someone on a moving train. An interesting aspect of this is that it's possible for two people to calculate two different values for the momentum of an object, but somehow all of the underlying physics is unaffected by the different values.  The SI units of momentum are . By itself, this doesn't say very much. But if we compare it to the units of force, we can see that the two are very similar. The SI units of force are . The only difference between the two is that force has an extra dimension of seconds in the denominator. In other words, force has units of momentum over time.  In fact, the connection runs much deeper. Newton's Second Law of Motion can actually be phrased in terms of momentum:    The net force on an object at any instant of time is equal to the rate of change of its momentum.    In other words, forces lead to changes in momentum. This idea is written mathematically in the following manner: . The notation can be read as \"the change of\" and is a common notation in both math and physics. (You might remember seeing the formula for the slope of a line as . It's the exact same thing.) By multiplying both sides of the equation by , we have another version of the equation: . This is the formula for impulse, which we will discuss in the next section.    Angular Momentum  Angular momentum is the momentum of spinning objects. It's quite a bit more complicated than linear momentum, and it's even less intuitive when you get into the details. If you have a record spinning on a standard record player, the angular momentum is pointing up because it is spinning counter-clockwise. The exact reason it's pointing up and the consequences of that are difficult to understand intuitively. In some sense, the reason is that this is what works out mathematically. But that's unsatisfying.  Instead of trying to get the full flavor of angular momentum and its consequences, we are going to think about some of the basic ideas and try to build some core intuitions about it. The underlying question is about how difficult it is to get something to rotate (or to stop rotating). We will use a thought experiment. Suppose you are holding a stick with a weighted ball at the end of it. Will it be easier or harder to swing twist the stick so that the ball swings around if the stick is short or long?  Most people intuitively understand that the long stick would be more difficult, and that is the correct answer. So this tells us that angular momentum depends on how far away from the axis of rotation. It also depends on the mass, just as with linear angular momentum.

  "title": "Changing Momentum",
  "body": " Changing Momentum     -----   ------   In the previous section, we derived the equation from Newton's Second Law of Motion when framed in terms of momentum. In this section, we are going to explore what this means.    Defining Impulse   impulse    Impulse is the change of momentum of an obejct when it is acted on by a force. Specifically, it is calculated as , where the force is fixed and applied over a period of time .    There are a couple aspects about this that are conceptually easy to understand. The first is that larger forces should lead to larger changes of momentum. The second is that a force applied over a longer period of time should lead to a larger change of momentum than the same amount of force being applied for a short period of time. And both of these intuitions are captured in the formula for impulse.    Calculating Impulse  The exact nature of the force that is being applied can be extremely complicated. If you think about a collision in slow motion, you will see all sorts of deformations happen between the two objects. This is extremely difficult to model. However, we can understand the big picture of impulse without having to think about any of those details. All we really need to think about is the before and after behaviors.  We will typically think about the average force applied to the object by assuming it's constant for the entire time of interaction. This is another conceptual simplification to avoid having to create extremely complex models. For very short interactions, this ends up being a very reasonable thing to do.    A Basic Momentum Change Problem  Consider a baseball traveling 30 meters per second from the pitcher to the batter. And imagine the batter hits it straight back to the pitcher at 35 meters per second. Even though we have no information about the batter or the bat used to hit the ball, we can calculate the total impulse applied to the ball by calculating the change of momentum. (A baseball weighs about 0.15 kg.) We will consider the positive direction to be from the pitcher to the batter.   The initial momentum is .  The final momentum is .  The change in momentum is the final momentum minus the initial momentum: (in units of ).   Suppose further that the time of interaction between the bat and the ball is calculated to be 0.7 ms (or 0.0007 s). We can now calculate the average force of applied to the ball by the bat during the hit.   The negative sign on the force tells us that the force is being applied towards the pitcher, which makes sense. It's difficult to interpret what 1400 Newtons means. But we can convert the force to an acceleration and then think about it in terms of g-force.   The concept of 1000 gs is perhaps a little bit easier to conceptualize, though it may still seem a bit bizarre that this is what's happening to a baseball when it gets hit. A framework that might be helpful for this is to think about dropping a ball and waiting until it reaches a speed of 65 meters per second (the change in velocity), which is about 145 miles per hour. This would take a while. What 1000 gs means is that this happens in 1\/1000 the amount of time. In other words, in less than the blink of an eye, it goes from your hand dropping it to 65 meters per second.       (OpenStax College Physics 2e) Section 8.2 Impulse      "

The Principle of Conservation of Momentum  We will begin with the statement of the principle of conservation of momentum.    The total momentum in any isolated system remains constant.    When we talk about the total momentum of a system, we are talking about the sum of all of the momentum vectors of all the particles in the system. Since this is a vector calculation, it's possible that the total momentum of the system is zero even though there are particles moving around in it. We also need to make sure that we are using the same frame of reference for both the before and after calculations.   isolated system An isolated system is a system that has no external forces acting on it. You want to imagine that you've isolated all of the components of the interaction to some far-off corner of space, far from everything. When working on problems, this is simple enough to do because we tend to only include the objects that are interacting in our calculations. In practice, this mostly means keeping people away from the experiment and making sure that the interaction happens horizontally to avoid the influence of gravity.  It is important to remember that this is talking about the influence of external forces. Objects within the system can have all sorts of complicated interactions with each other without violating the conservation of momentum.   "

  "title": "Collisions",
  "body": " Collisions     -----   ------    elastic collision  inelastic collision We will be using the principle of conservation of momentum to analyze what happens in collisions. This topic is usually presented with a discussion of the energy of the system, which breaks the world of collisions into two categories. If no energy is lost, then the collision is said to be elastic . These types of collisions basically do not exist in reality, and are considered to be a theoretical ideal. A collision in which energy is lost is said to be inelastic . The ways that energy would typically be lost would be through heat and sound, and while we say that the energy is lost, it's more correct to say that the energy has been converted into another form that cannot be accounted for in the motion of the particles.  The algebra of these calculations can get a little bit difficult, and it's easy to get lost in the details. So we're going to focus on setting up the equations and laying out the trajectory of the algebra, but we won't get bogged down in those details.    A Moving Mass Hits and Sticks to a Stationary Mass  In the first scenario, we're going to imagine a mass is traveling with velocity and collides with another mass , which is at rest. After the two masses collide, they stick together and act as a single object. We are interested in how fast the combined object is moving. We begin by creating diagrams that represent the motion before and after the collision. We will label the final velocity of the combined object as .  INSERT DIAGRAM  Before the collision, the momentum of the system is . After the collision, the momentum of the system is . Since momentum is conserved, we know that these two quantities are equal to each other. So we can set up an equation to solve for .   The important observation about this equation is that the two objects together will always be moving slower than the object by itself. This should make intuitive sense because if it were moving faster, there would have to be something that propelled it forward after the two pieces collided. If is large compared to , the result would be that the combined object is moving close to the initial speed of the mass. If is small compared to , then the combined object will be moving very slowly. Both of these scenarios should feel fairly intuitive.  Note that the kinetic energy after the collision is In other words, we can directly calculate the proportion of the energy that is lost in the interaction based on the masses, even though we have no information about the interaction. This means that the collision is inelastic.    A Moving Mass Bounces off of a Stationary Mass Elastically  We will now consider the scenario with the same initial condition, but a different outcome. The mass travels with velocity and collides with another mass , which is at rest. This time, we will assume that they remain two separate entities after the collision and that the collision is purely elastic, meaning that no energy is lost. We will assume that the final state has mass traveling with velocity (which may be positive or negative) and mass traveling with velocity (which will always be positive).  Conservation of momentum leads to the equation Conservation of energy leads to the equation There is a bit of algebra to do here. It's not particularly difficult, but there are just a lot of steps. In the end, you get the following results: Notice that the direction of the mass depends on whether it has more or less mass than mass . If the mass is smaller, it bounces back, and if the mass is larger, then it continues forward. And if the masses are identical, then the mass comes to a stop.    Two-Dimensional Collisions  We can use the same techniques to solve for collisions in two dimensions. This would be the classic setup for billiard balls, where instead of hitting the ball straight-on, it is hit to one side or the other. This requires us to introduce two more variables and , which represent the angles at which the balls leaves the collision relative to the initial velocity. Solving these equations requires a bit of trigonometry and a lot of algebra, so we're going to skip all of the details.  The important fact when thinking about this problem is that momentum is conserved in all directions. If we have the initial particle traveling in the x-direction, then the momentum in the y-direction after the collision will be zero.   "

  "title": "Center of Mass",
  "body": " Center of Mass     -----   ------   ...    The Center of Mass   center of mass This entire discussion of momentum so far has side-stepped a very important concept known as the center of mass of the object (or system of objects). The center of mass has a particular formula for how to calculate it, but the basic idea is that it's the balance point of the object.  We have implicitly been treating the objects as individual points with no dimension, but real objects are not like that. They are composed of many different parts that are connected to each other, all the way down to the level of individual atoms. And when two objects collide, different parts of the object experience that collision differently. This can lead to very complicated physics models and equations.  There is some good news. All of the physics we've done so far is completely valid for modeling the behavior of the center of mass of an object. That is, if we look at our equations and only focus on the center of mass, everything we have done will be completely correct. So we have the correct analysis for the general behavior of objects.  But there is also some bad news. The dynamics we've been talking about do not take into account some of the more intricate behaviors of the constituent pieces. A basic example would a bolo ball (which is a piece of string with a ball tied to each end). If you were to throw a bolo ball, the center of mass would follow a nice parabolic trajectory, but the two balls might be spinning all over the place. The work that we've done is not enough to account for the individual behavior of the two balls. We can only work with the center of mass.    The Reference Frame of the Center of Mass  We have noted several times that the exact equations that you end up with when working with a physics problem will depend on the point of view that is being taken. It turns out that many problems can be simplified by viewing it from the perspective of the center of mass. The reason this is helpful is because from this point of view the total momentum of the system is zero. And since momentum is conserved, we can know that the final momentum is going to be zero as well.  Let's look back at collision where the two objects stick together. If we are trying to think about this from the point of view of the center of mass, then in the final result, we would just have the combined mass with no velocity. If we were to now work backwards, we would see that before the collision the two masses are headed towards each other, and those velocities are the only variables. In other words, we've reduced the problem to just two variables instead of three. This sort of trick is even more helpful for the two-dimensional collisions whose details we completely skipped.    Explosions and Center of Mass  In some physics problems, you end up with more pieces than you started with. These are typically caused by explosions, and we'll focus on just that case.  Suppose that we have a ball that contains a small explosive. We throw the ball and the explosive is detonated, which breaks the ball into many pieces. What can we know about the locations of the pieces when they hit the ground? This is an extremely complicated problem, as the explosion may cause pieces to fly in all directions, and each piece may end up having a different mass.  However, the physics of the center of mass does give us some information about the situation. Even though the ball exploded, the center of mass will continue to follow the equations of projectile motion. This means that if you were to look at the locations where each piece of the ball hit the ground and compute the center of mass, that location would be the place where the ball would have landed if it didn't explode.

  "title": "The Lever",
  "body": " The Lever     Give me a place to stand and I will move the earth!   Archimedes   The first of the simple machines that we're going to study is the lever. This has the ability to multiply and redirect an input force. The input force is often called the \"effort\" and the object that is being moved is often called the \"load\". The \"output force\" is the force that is being used to counter the load.    The Lever   fulcrum The lever consists of a solid beam and a pivot point (called the fulcrum ). Here is the formula for the mechanical advantage: In other words, if the force is applied 2 meters from the fulcrum and the output force is 1 meter from the fulcrum, the lever creates a mechanical advantage of 2 (meaning that the output force is 2 times as large as the input force). Notice that if you think about the distances involved, the output force can only move half of the distance that the input force moves. This is an example of the tradeoff that you get with mechanical advantages.   torque The underlying physical mechanism for the lever is known as torque . Torque is a twisting or rotational force and is the result of applying a force a distance from a pivot point. In simple cases, it is calculated as the product of the force and the distance from the pivot, which is known as the lever arm (the distance from the pivot and the point where the force is applied).    Classes of Levers  Levers come in three types, depending on the relative locations of the fulcrum, the effort, and the load.   first class lever If the effort is on the opposite side of the fulcrum as the load, then it is a first class lever . This is the classic type of seesaw pattern that most people think of when it comes to levers. Whether there is a mechanical advantage in this case will depend on the distances between the fulcrum and the load or the effort.   second class lever If the load is between the fulcrum and the effort, then it is a second class lever . An example of this type of lever is a wheelbarrow. In that case, the fulcrum is the part that attaches to the wheel, the load is the barrel, and then you lift the handles that stick beyond the barrel. In this case, there will always be a mechanical advantage because the distance from the fulcrum to the effort will always be larger than the distance from the fulcrum to the load.   third class lever If the effort is between the fulcrum and the load, then it is a third class lever . An example of this type of lever is a broom. The fulcrum is the tip of the handle, the effort is where you push the broom handle to sweep, and the load (the stuff being swept) is all the way at the head of the broom. The benefit of this type of lever is that you are multiplying distance rather than multiplying force. Since the objects being swept are light, the force that your body can generate is much greater than necessary to move them. The broom allows you to move your hands a couple dozen centimeteres but move dirt and dust on the floor more than a meter.    Compound Levers   compound levers It is possible to get even greater multiplication of forces by using compound levers . A compound lever is when a lever is being used against another lever.  An example of a compound lever is a tortilla press. The top plate is on a hingle, which creates the first lever. The tortilla is between the hinge and the edge of the plate where the pressure will be placed, making it a second class lever. We can imagine that the tortilla dough is halfway between the hinge and the handle, resulting in a mechanical advantage of 2 (though people usually place it closer to the hinge, which makes sense from a mechanical advantage perspective). Then the handle is pressed down on the edge of the top plate, creating the second lever. This is also a second class lever because the hinge is on the outside of the plate. Typically, the place where the handle presses on the top plate is just a couple centimeters, but the handle is often 30 cm or more. This means that the mechanical advantage here is 15. But because this is being applied to a lever that also multiplies force, the total multiplication of force is 30.    Applications  The basic application of levers is to require less force to get things done. A long metal pipe turns out to be an incredibly useful tool if you are working in any sort of shop where you might need to use wrenches. By putting the metal pipe over the end of any wrench, you can greatly multiply the force that you can apply with the wrench. This is also advice I've heard for people who may be driving out in less populated areas and may need to change their own tire. Sometimes, cars come with really small tire irons that just aren't big enough to knock loose the lug nuts. But if you have a 3 foot long metal pipe to slide over the end of it, you won't have any problems with that.    The Chair Challenge   The Chair Challenge was a physics activity that went viral several years ago.    Instructions  Get a chair (or an object of a similar size and weight). Stand with one heel against the wall and measure out two foot-lengths (not two feet, two lengths of your foot) from the wall. Turn around and place the chair between you and the Bend at the waist and lean forward so that your head is against the wall. Try to lift the chair and stand upright.  It turns out that women will generally be able to do this, but men will struggle. The reason is that men's feet tend to be larger than women's feet, so they are slightly further away from the wall. Those extra couple inches turn out to change the amount of leverage that they can generate, with men losing just enough to make it very hard to lift the chair.  There is a similar trick that is done where a person (typically a woman) makes themselves impossible to lift. This is accomplished by leaning away from the person as they try to lift, causing an increase in the lever arm and increasing the amount of force required to lift them.    "

  "title": "The Wheel and Axle",
  "body": " The Wheel and Axle     ...   ...   The second of the simple machines that we're going to study is the wheel and axle. In a certain sense, this is just a lever. The difference is that this lever is attached to a rotating device rather than a fixed beam. This allows for the mechanical advantage to be used repeatedly and continuously. It's important to remember that a wheel and axle is more than just a wheel. Having a circular hoop roll down a hill does not demonstrate the mechanical advantage that we get from a wheel and axle. In fact, a wheel with an axle still doesn't create a wheel and axle if the wheel rotates freely around the axis.    The Wheel and Axle  A wheel and axle consists of a wheel that is connected to a smaller axle so that they rotate together. There are two concepts that come together in this arrangement. The first is that rotating the wheel acts like a lever on the axle, so that the effort is multiplied (but not always by a number greater than 1). The second concept is that the force can be applied indefinitely because the wheel can rotate around repeatedly, whereas with a lever the effort is typically only applied over a small angle.  Since the underlying mechanism is similar to a lever, the formula for the mechanical advantage for a wheel and axle should seem familiar. It is found in the relative radii of the wheel and axle, which mirrors the idea of thinking about the distances from the fulcrum to the effort and load.   The formula for the mechanical advantage is the ideal mechanical advantage. Due to friction, the wheel and axle typically do not achieve the full mechanical advantage. Because of this, it is sometimes better to talk about the efficiency of the wheel, which is a measure of how much power you actually get out of the system compared to the power that goes in.  It is essential for a wheel and axle system to have the wheel and axle fixed in their relative positions. In other words, it is not a wheel and axle if the wheel rotates independently of the axle. The reason is that you are no longer gaining the mechanical advantage in the axle in this situation. On a technical note, it is possible to have a wheel and axle system that isn't using the mechanical advantage. If you have a wheel fixed to an axle, but the axle rotates freely inside of some other mechanism, you have a wheel and axle system, but you're not using it to generate a mechanical advantage. You're just using it like a wheel.    Driving the Wheel or the Axle  In the typical case of the wheel and axle, the effort is placed on the wheel. This is to create the mechanical advantage that multiplies the output force. However, in some cases (such as cars), the effort is placed on the axis. This results in the output force of the wheel being smaller than the input force on the axle. This is similar to the idea of a third class lever where the force that being created ends up being much larger than the force required to accomplish the task. Then there is some level of savings (whether in physical motion or physical space) that can be gained by driving the axle.    Applications  The wheel and axle is a very powerful combination that can be found in many times and places in history. Some common examples include pulling a bucket of water up a well (though in many situations, the wheel is replaced by a crank to reduce the amount of material required) and the wheels of ships (the reason the wheels are always so large is to maximize the mechanical advantage to steer the a large, heavy ship). A modern example of this mechanism is a screwdriver, where the larger radius handle is used to create a mechanical advantage to turn a screw.   "

  "title": "The Pulley",
  "body": " The Pulley     ...   ...   The pulley is the first of the simple machines that only redirects force without providing a mechanical advantage. This isn't to say that pulleys can't be used in certain configurations to create a mechanical advantage. It just means that the pulley does not inherently generate the mechanical advantage.    The Pulley  A pulley is a wheel on an axle that allows a rope to be pulled taut against it. Theoretically, the pulley allows for the full applied force to be redirected through the rope, but in practice we might need to consider the friction of the wheel against the axle as a cause of reduction of force.  Pulleys can either be fixed or movable, depending on what it is attached to and how that object behaves relative to the system. For example, a pulley connected to the ceiling of a room would normally be considered a fixed pulley because its location is set. If the ceiling started to move, we would typically think that something went wrong. A pulley attached to a package would normally be considered a movable pulley because we would typically expect that the package is an object that is meant to move as a result of the pulleys.    Single-Pulley Configurations  There are two configurations you can create with a pulley, and it depends on whether the pulley is fixed or movable.  A fixed pulley only has the ability to redirect force through the rope. In the configuration shown below, the force applied to the rope results in a force applied to the load. The pulley does the work of redirecting the input force from the downward direction to an upward output force. Even though there is no theoretical gain from the pulley, this configuration does help to lift the object. The reason is that it is easier to pull down on an object than it is to lift up. When pulling down, you can use your body weight to help, but when lifting up you have to work against body weight because you are having to hold it up with your legs.  A movable pulley has the ability to generate a mechanical advantage of 2. By using the configuration below, the object now experiences the force of two ropes pulling upward on it instead of just one. When thinking about this scenario, it helps to isolate just the object and ignore the other pulleys. You can see that there are two ropes that are pulling up on the object, and it turns out that it doesn't matter what's on the other end of those ropes. All that matters is that there are two ropes pulling upward on it with the same amount of force.  The tradeoff of the movable pulley arrangement is that the object moves only half the distance that the rope is pulled. The reason for this is that there are two places where the rope needs to get shorter as you pull, and this doubles the amount of rope that needs to be pulled.    Systems of Pulleys  A system of pulleys is just a combination of multiple pulleys. Some pulleys have multiple wheels in a single mechanism, and this is sometimes referred to as a block and tackle pulley system. However, a block and tackle system can be recreated using individual pulleys. The advantage is often found in reducing the number of places where the pulley needs to be attached, and some block and tackle pulleys are built specifically for high loads (because that is the nature of their uses). The diagram below shows how a set of two-wheel block and tackles can be replaced by four individual pulleys.  The idea behind the block and tackle is that you can multiply the force even further. A two-wheel block and tackle creates a mechanical advantage of 4 because there are 4 ropes pulling upward on the object. A three-wheel block and tackle will create a mechanical advantage of 8.  It is possible to get a mechanical advantage of 8 with only 3 pulleys, but it requires being able to tie the pulleys to multiple locations. The key way to think about it as a system of single movable pulleys that are each doubling the force.    Applications  There is a story about Archimedes that is usually shared when it comes to pulleys. As the story is told, a large ship called the Syracusia was built, but it was too large to be pulled to sea by ordinary means. So Archimedes set up a system of pulleys and cranks and (in some tellings of the story) single-handedly dragged the ship from land into the sea. Unsurprisingly, the use of pulleys is very common in ships. Ships are heavy objects with heavy parts that move, and pulleys allow these things to be moved without needing as much input force.  Pulleys are often found in vehicles that have winches, because pulleys allow those winches to increase their capacity through the mechanical advantages that they can create.  A special type of pulley is the snatch block, which allows you to add a pulley in the middle of a rope without having to access the ends. This can be very useful in situations where the ends of the rope might be fixed, or you can't undo the ends of the rope without undermining the larger system.

  "body": " The Inclined Plane     ...   ...   The inclined plane is the first simple machine that we will look at that has no moving parts. It is actually the fundamental structure for the remaining two simple machines.    The Inclined Plane  The inclined plane is just a sloped ramp. The inclined plane allows one to raise an object up while not needing to lift the entire weight of the object. We are actually using the normal force of the ramp on the object to help offset some of the downward force of gravity.  The mechanical advantage is the ratio of the upward force required to lift the object with the ramp to the original weight of the object. In other words, it's the implied multiplier of force when lifting. This value could be derived using trigonometry and free body diagrams, but it turns out that this value also happens to be the ratio of the length of the slope to the height of the ramp. We've seen this in other machines where the tradeoff of distance ends up giving us the same ratio as the force multiplier. If the length of the ramp is equal to the height of the ramp, then you're lifting straight up. As the ramp gets longer, more and more of the ramp is supporting the weight of the object.     Friction and Ramps  Since the object is sliding up the ramp as you push, there is an additional friction force that must be overcome before the object moves. Although it's possible to try to slide an object up a ramp, it is more often the case that the object is placed on wheels. This has the advantage of mostly eliminating the friction and helping to keep the necessary force to a minimum. However, the absence of friction works in both directions, and it's possible to lose an object rolling down an inclined plane.    Application  Perhaps one of the most obviouis applications of a ramp are accessibility ramps. The law provides requirements for the slope of the ramps in order to ensure that they are both useful and safe. The maximum slope of a ramp is 12 feet of ramp for 1 foot of elevation, which means that the mechanical advantage must be at least 12. In order to protect the users, there are also limits to the rise of a single inclined section so that there are meaningful breaks in the ramp to allow for rest and also to prevent unbroken downhill rolls.

It's viewed as a different type of machine primarily because the uses are completely different from that of the inclined plane.    The Wedge  A wedge is a tool that is shaped like a narrow triangle that is used to separate an object into two pieces. The pointy end is usually partially inserted into the object being separated, then the narrow flat side is struck with an object like a hammer. As the wedge gets pushed downward into the object, the sides of the triangle cause the parts of the object on either side to separate.  Since the wedge is just a small inclined plane, it is not surprising that the formula for mechanical advantage follows the same pattern. If the wedge is positioned like an inclined plane, the various lengths line up very closely. The match isn't perfect, but it's close enough to make it seem intuitive.  From the formula for mechanical advantage, we can see that a long, thin wedge gives a better advantage than a short, stubby wedge.    Applications  Wedges are sometimes used when splitting wood. The wedge is driven partially into the wood with a few soft blows, and then heavier blows are applied to drive it in deeply. Sometimes, wedges are used in the form of an axe used to split wood. Rather than placing the wedge on the object and hitting it, the axe's momentum is used to drive the wedge into the wood. Depending on your skill level, this can result in many missed blows with the axe. Mechanical wood splitters do the same thing, except using pneumatics to press the wedge into the wood (or sometimes, the wood into the wedge). This allows for more precise splitting than an axe.  Wedges are also used to split rocks at a quarry, though the process is a bit different. When splitting rock, several wedges are spaced out across the desired cutting direction, and the wedges are slowly driven in. A device known as a plug and feather (which is just a wedge inside of a special sheath) is used in order to try to maintain control of the crack that forms.   "

  "title": "The Screw",
  "body": " The Screw     ...   ...   A screw is a small wedge that has been wrapped around a cylinder. It is the only one that converts rotational motion into linear motion, and that linear motion drives the screw deeper into the object it is attached to.    The Screw  The screw is possibly the most complex of the simple machines. It shares features of the wheel and axle in that there are rotational forces that drive the system. However, the wheel and axle uses rotational motion to create rotational motion (the wheel drives the axle), and it requires a rope to convert that rotational motion into a linear motion. With the screw, the rotational motion is turned directly into the linear motion of the screw itself.  The screw also shares features of the inclined plane. The inclined plane reduces the amount of force required to lift an object, and in this case that gets translated into reducing the amount of force required to push the screw deeper into the object.  The calculation of the mechanical advantage of a screw is a bit more complicated than previous machines. Since we are converting a rotational force to a linear force, it does not make sense to use a ratio of forces as the mechanical advantage. (Technically, you would be taking the ratio of a torque and a force, which would leave units of distance.) Instead, we have to think about distances. What is the ratio of applied motion and what is the resulting distance that the screw travels?  For the applied motion, we calculate the circumference of the head of the screw. Conceptually, this means that we are thinking of getting the maximal advantage of the screw by pressing on the edge of the screw giving ourselves the largest radius to work with.  For the output motion, we will use the pitch of the screw. The pitch is the distance of one winding of the threads around the screw. In other words, it's the distance that the screw would move if you turned it one time, corresponding to moving around the circumference of the screw one time. In many cases, screws are described by the number of threads per unit length (per inch, per centimeter), and the pitch ends up being the reciprocal of that quantity.    Applications  Screws have many applications. The screw itself is used to attach two different objects together, but there's a lot more to this machine.  The value of the screw is actually in the threading, which is what causes the motion when turning. Having rotating threads is a way to create linear motion out of rotational motion. Normally, that motion is about moving the screw, but if you simply have a threaded rod, that rod can be used to move something else. Threaded rods can be found in many high precision mechanical devices because they provide a lot of control over distance. A rod may have a pitch of a couple millimeters, but a stepper motor might have 200 steps per rotation. In other words, the distance control is 0.5% of the pitch, which can bring it down to the order of tens of micrometers. This is what allows for very high precision machining to be done.  Another use of a screw to move things is the Archimedes screw. This is a screw that can be used to move water (or other substances) from a low place to a high place by rotating it. The concept is that putting a screw inside of a cylinder, you can use the walls of the cylinder to help contain the material and drive the motion by turning the screw.   "

However, just because a machine is considered a compound machine, it doesn't mean that the machine is necessarily complicated. We will look at a few examples.    Examples of Compound Machines    A tortilla press is a combination of two levers. The part that flattens the tortilla is a second class lever because the load (the tortilla) is in between the fulcrum (the hinge) and the effort (the outer edge of the top plate). On top of that lever, there's another second class lever. The distance between the fulcrum (the hinge) and the load (the contact point between the arm and the top plate) is small and the lever is long, which creates a very large mechanical advantage. The total mechanical advantage is the product of the mechanical advantage of each part.    A pair of scissors is a common example of a compound machine. The blades of the scissors are each a separate wedge, and the pivot point and handles form two opposing first class levers. From this, we can see that scissors with short handles will have less cutting power than scissors with long handles. In fact,    Bolt cutters are not just a large pair of scissors. You would not get enough of a mechanical advantage from that. If you look closely at the operation of a pair of bolt cutters, you'll see that there are two levers. So in addition to the initial mechanical advantage of having long arms, there's an additional mechanism that greatly multiplies the force.     "

  "body": " Gears     ...   ...   Gears are typically not considered to be simple machines because a single gear does not have the ability to change the direction of a force or change its magnitude. (If it is being used to change the direction of a force, it's just acting as a pulley.) However, when multiple gears are used together, you can get both a change in the magnitude of a force as well as the direction.  It's worth noting that some people do try to say that gears are simple machines. I don't know if it's worth getting into an argument over that.    A Brief Overview of Gears  The study of gears and gear mechanisms can be an entire chapter on its own. And maybe some day in this text, it will be. But for now, we're going to just give a general overview of them and leave the exploration of gears as a lab.  The basic premise of gears is that they are wheel and axles but with teeth that act like a lever. The teeth \"mesh\" together, meaning that the teeth maintain the basic relationship between two gears that are connected to each other. If one rotates, so does the other. Sometimes a loop of chains is used to link two gears together so that they can be meshed together but be physically far apart.  One of the big ideas of gears is that the size of the gear (diameter) is directly related to the number of teeth that the gear has, and having different numbers of teeth lead to different types of mechanical behaviors. A large gear can rotate a small gear very quickly, and a force (torque) applied to a small gear can be magnified using a large gear.  There are also different types of gears that can be used. A linear gear can mesh with a regular gear to convert rotational motion into linear motion. A worm gear can be used to have a fine control over gears and lock them in position. Compound gears are a mechanism that the same rotational speed can be used to generate two different linear speeds.  There is much more that can be said, but this needs to be put to rest for now.   "

Equipment List    A gear set (two 12-tooth gears, two 24-tooth gears, two 30-tooth gears, two 36-tooth gears, two linear gears, two linear gear backing plates, one base plate)      Procedure  We are going to explore a number of different aspects of gears through experimentation and observation.    Take the two 12-tooth gears and mesh them on the the base plate so that they rotate together. Rotate one of the 12-tooth gears one full rotation and determine how much the other gear rotates. This value is known as the gear ratio. (Note: There is a line on the gears that you can use to help keep track of the position.) Repeat this with every combination of round gears. An example chart has been provided for you below.    We will now make a sequence of three gears. Mesh the followings gears in the indicated order: 12-24-30. They do not all need to be in a straight line. They just need to bein the correct order. Record how far the 24-tooth and 30-tooth gears rotate and in which direction when the 12-tooth gear does one complete rotation in the clockwise direction. Then pick 4 more sequences of three gears and do the same exercise. Record the results.    We will next work with the linear gear. You will need to use the linear gear backing plate to hold the linear gear up against the round gear. Note that the two sides of the backing piece are different sizes, so you might need to turn it around to get the appropriate distance. Create the following sequence of gears: Linear-12-24-Linear. As you push the first linear gear (attached to the 12-tooth gear), the other linear gear should move. Determine how much faster or slower the second linear gear moves relative to the first one (twice as fast, half as fast, same speed, etc.). Pick 4 more pairs of round gears in the middle and repeat the experiment.    The peg of a round gears can be placed in the hole of another round gear to create a compound gear. We will always put the smaller gear on the bottom. (Otherwise, the gear mechanism won't function properly.) If you put the 24-tooth gear on top of the 12-tooth gear, we will denote that as [12,24]. Create the following sequence of gears: Linear-12-[12,24]-Linear. Note that the 12-tooth gear should be meshed with the 12-tooth gear of the [12,24] gear, and that the second linear gear should be meshed with the 24-tooth gear. Determine how much faster or slower the second linear gear moves relative to the first one (twice as fast, half as fast, same speed, etc.). Pick 4 more combinations of a round gears with a compound gear in the middle and repeat the experiment. (Note: Due to the physical sizes of the gears, some combinations may not function. If that happens, just pick another one and try again.)      Sample Charts  The gear at the top of the column is rotated one time.

  "body": " Defining Rigid Structures     .....   .....   In this chapter, we're going to analyze the properties of rigid structures. We will consider a rigid structure to be a structure that consists of a single body that does not flex or bend. In practice, a rigid structure can be composed of many pieces, but with the restriction that the pieces are not intended to move relative to each other so that they behave as if they are a single body. Also, the reality is that all objects will flex and bend somewhat, but we are going to assume that the flexing is small relative to the size of the object, so that we can think of the object as not flexing at all.    Rigid Bodies and Forces  There are many applications of physics where it is helpful to think about objects as rigid bodies. For example, buildings and bridges can be seen as rigid bodies for the purposes of thinking about how well they would hold up under loads and other types of strains.  We can think about the an object at many different levels. We can think about the body as a whole, or we can think of it as being multiple rigid pieces. As we allow objects to be built of more and more pieces, it results in more complex physics. When looking at the object as a whole, we are usually working with the external forces on the object. When looking at the object as multiple individual pieces, we're usually talking about the internal forces on an object. If the rigidity is lost when thinking of the individual pieces, the object basically breaks. We will be spending some time looking at both situations.   "

  "title": "Stable Structures",
  "body": " Stable Structures     .....   .....   There are two types of stability that we will be looking at. The first is the stability of the whole object, focusing on the question of whether the object is going to stay where it is or if it will topple over. The second is the internal stability of the object, focusing on ways that objects can break.    Stability: Center of Mass  Consider an unsharpened pencil. With a little bit of work, it's possible to get the pencil to stand on the flat, unsharpened end without tipping over. But what condition is needed in order for it to stay upright? It turns out that we need to focus on the center of mass. As long as the center of mass is above of the base of the pencil (the flat surface that it's supposed to rest on), it will not fall over.  This gives us an explanation for some of our basic intuitions about objects and balance. Objects are harder to balance on a small base because the location of the center of mass only has a small area where it can be before it falls over. But objects with a wide base are more stable because the center of mass has a lot more room to move while still being inside the base. Furthermore, even if the object happens to roll a little bit, if the base is large, the object will fall back to the base instead of tipping over.  Items that are \"top-heavy\" fall over more easily, and this is due to geometry. When the center of mass is far from the base, a small change of angle can result in a large movement of the center of mass. This means that it's easier for the object's center of mass to go outside of the base, which makes it easier for it to fall over.    Internal Stability  Internal stability is about maintaining the relationships between the different parts of the object. That stability is maintained by many forces.  When a rigid body is put under some sort of strain, there are internal forces that hold the object together to keep it from breaking. If the strain forces get too large, then the object will begin to warp and bend, and in some cases it will snap.  If there are two rigid bodies being held together, the forces used to hold them together are often through connecting pieces (like screws or nuts and bolts) or an adhesive. It is often helpful to use multiple connecting pieces to maintain the relationship between two bodies in order to resist having pieces rotate. An adhesive can be modeled as a lot of small connecting pieces, except that the connecting pieces are not nearly as strong  If there are more than two rigid bodies being held together, we can use other types of geometric concepts to help maintain the shape. Triangles are often used in construction because they resist changes to their shape. A shape like a rectangle can collapse in a process sometimes called parallelgramming.   "

Tension in Rigid Bodies  Tension in a rigid body is one of the internal forces described in the previous section. If we imagine trying to bend a rod, what's happening is that we are trying to make the \"outer\" part of the bend longer by stretching it. The tension force is the force that is resisting that bend and is keeping the rod straight. On the \"innter\" part of the bend, there is compression, as that side is being pressed inward.    Tension in Ropes  Ropes have the property that they can only be used for pulling, but not pushing. This leads to a number of interesting physical properties.  The tension in a rope is generally assumed to be the same throughout its whole length. That is, if you were to treat the rope as two pieces being held together by tension, the tension you calculate does not depend on where you choose to break the rope.  As the tension in a rope goes to zero, the rope goes slack and is no longer transmitting any forces.   "

Equipment List    A box of toothpicks (a couple hundred is enough)    Hot glue gun    Several books and\/or binders    Craft paper, cardboard, or other protective surface so you don't damage the table you're working on      Procedure  We are going to create a number of three-dimensional shapes out of toothpicks. Then we will test them to see how strong they are.    Lay out the protective surface on top of whatever table you're working on.    Use the hot glue gun to stick the ends of the toothpicks together to make four of each of the following shapes:   Cube: Create two squares and then attach the appropriate corners together with a toothpick in the middle.    Reinforced Cube: Create a cube, then add diagonal pieces to the four vertical sides. You can break the toothpicks for the cube to make them smaller if you wanted to go from corner-to-corner. But if you don't want to do that, you can just attach the diagonals to the sides of the square.    Pyramid with square base: Create a square, then add one vertical toothpick from each of the corners to create the pyramid.       For each shape, arrange the four pieces in a rectangle so that the first book and\/or binder rests comfortably on them. (For the pyramids, the tip of the pyramid should point upward). After everything appears to be stable, give the weight a little nudge in each direction to see if it remains stable. (It should survive this.)    Add a second weight and repeat the process. Continue adding weights until the structure fails. If you run out of weights before the structure fails, you can push downward on it to try to get it to fail. Be sure to give it a nudge in each direction after each weight to check for overall stability. When the structure fails, make a note of how it failed. Here are some potential observations to consider: Did it fail during a nudge or by simply adding weight? Did a toothpick break, or did a glue joint fail?      Discussion    Which of your structures was the strongest?    Which of your structures was the weakest?    What ideas do you have for making a stronger structure?

  "title": "Understanding Pressure",
  "body": " Understanding Pressure     .....   .....   In this chapter, we're going to explore the concept of pressure and consider its multiple applications.    What is Pressure?  Up to this point, we've been thinking about forces as being applied to a single point or location. But in reality, this never actually happens because we don't ever have a force applying to a single point. The force is always spread out over an area. If you are pushing against an object, the force you are creating with your body is spread out over whatever part is in contact with the thing you are pushing against, whether that's your hand or your shoulder.  Pressure is a value that takes into account the area over which the force is being spread. Specifically, the formula for pressure is , where is the total force and is the total area over which that force is spread out. Another way to think about it is that pressure is a measure of how concentrated the applied force is.  The SI units for pressure is known as Pascals (Pa), named after the physicist Blaise Pascal who first developed the idea of pressure. One Pascal is one Newton of force spread out over a square meter of area. This is a very small quantity. For example, atmospheric pressure is about 100,000 Pa. For this reason, people working in SI units often use units of kPa. In fields where they aren't using Si units, you will find other units such as psi (pound-force per square inch), bars and millibars, and standard atmospheres (atm).    The Bed of Nails Trick  The concept of pressure can be used to explain the \"bed of nails\" trick. In this trick, a person lies down on a bed of nails without being pierced by any of them. But before we get to the full description of the trick and how it works, we're going to start with a thought exercise.  Suppose you have a 2-kg weight resting on your hand. (2 kg weight is about 4.4 pounds.) Do you anticipate that hurting? Probably not. But now suppose that we put that weight on top of a pin with the point of the pin pointing down on your hand. This will probably hurt a lot! (Note: It is not recommended that you try this.) The difference is that the force in the first case is spread out over whatever the shape of the weight is. However, in the second case, all of that weight is concentrated on a small area. This means that instead of a large portion of your hand supporting the weight, it's just the tiny piece of skin where the pin is located.  The bed of nails trick is this, but in the opposite direction. If we put a 90-kilo (200-pound) man on top of a single nail, that one nail will have to absorb his entire weight. But if you have 1000 nails, then the weight is spread out across all of those nails and each nail only carries 0.045 kilos (45 grams or 1.5 ounces) of weight. This is not enough to cause harm.   "

  "title": "Fluid Pressure",
  "body": " Fluid Pressure     .....   .....   The most common context for pressure is fluid pressure. In this case, the word fluid is a technical term that can refer to both liquids and gasses. In particular, a fluid is any substance that does not have a fixed shape, and both liquids and gasses have that property.    Conceptualizing Pressure  The particles of a fluid are always in motion. (If not, you would have a solid.) Pressure can be thought of as the force of those particles bouncing off an object. For example, if you put a small cube inside of a glass of water, there will be molecules of water bouncing off the side of the cube, and that bouncing imparts a force on that side of the cube. The reason that the cube doesn't move anywhere is that there are molecules of water bouncing off the other side, and the forces from each side balance each other out.  If we shrink the cube to be small, we would still have the same effect (as long as the cube is large relative to the density of the fluid). The cube will always have a balance of force on each side of it. Another way to say this is that the fluid pressure does not have a direction. The fluid particles are coming in from all directions all the time, and on average they will always balance themselves out.  (If the object is small relative to the density of the fluid, you start to get some random movement of the cube due to the forces on the sides not being in balance. This is known as brownian motion.)    Pressure from Gravity  We are going to consider the effect of gravity on pressure. If you are familiar with the implosion of the Titan submarine in 2003, you already have some sense for how depth and pressure are related. We will start by considering a vertical tube of water. If we picked a spot just below the surface of the water, we would see that there's only a small amount of water above it. This means that if we think about the impact of gravity at that depth, there would only be a small weight of water pushing downward on it. However, if we go to the bottom of the tube of water, there is now much more water above it and so the water at that depth is under more pressure.  Using this framework, it's possible to derive the formula for pressure at a depth in a fluid under gravity. The formula is , where is the density of the fluid (mass per volume), is the acceleration due to gravity, and is the depth of the fluid (vertical distance to the top of the fluid). This formula assumes that both the density and the acceleration due to gravity is constant over the depth of the fluid.  A more complex example of pressure from gravity is air pressure. Unlike with the example of the water tube, there is no physical container keeping the air in place. This means that it's not really clear how to calculate the \"depth\" of the fluid. Furthermore, both the acceleration due to gravity and the density of air changes with altitude. The important idea to have in mind is that the pressure decreases as the altitude increases.  An interesting artifact of fluid pressure under gravity is that (assuming the situation is static) the pressure is independent of the shape of the container. This is a surprising result when you think about how we derived the formula for pressure at a depth. In the derivation, we thought about the weight of the water above it. And from that, it might seem that if there is less water above it due to the shape of the container, that there would be less pressure.  The reason that the pressure is the same regardless of shape is complicated to explain, but there's an intuitive way to see why it can't be just the volume of water above it. Imagine that you have a container of water, and you covered the surface of the water with a solid plate with a hole in it. You would not expect the water to suddenly spray out of that hole. However, if you were to create a hole at any depth below the top of the water, you would expect the water to leak out of it regardless of the shape of the container, and you would expect it to leak until the water level reached the level of the hole. In some sense, this gives an indication that all of the water above that level has an impact, even if it's not directly above it.  This fact is what allows just a simple tube to be used as a level across long distances. There is an old adage that \"water seeks its own level\" and this is a reflection of this fact. As long as the water is connected and exposed to the environment, the top of the water will be the same at all of the points.    Visualizing Pressure at Different Depths  Activity: Fill a container of water. Poke holes at different depths of the same size. The water shoots out with more force where there's more pressure.   "

A common demonstration is breaking a piece of wood (like a ruler) using air pressure. Video . The air pressure is approximately 100 kPa (which is 14.7 psi).

  "body": " Hydraulics and Pneumatics     .....   .....   Hydraulics and penumatics are powerful tools for increasing force and transmitting forces over distances. Hydraulics use incompressible fluids and pneumatics use air, but both work on the principle of generating a force through pressure.    Theory  There are two key elements of the theory behind these tools. The first is that the pressure in the system is constant throughout, or at least reaches an equilibrium state where this is true. The second is that the force is proportional to the area.  The following is a basic representation of a simple hydraulic system. A force on the smaller side gets multiplied on the larger side because the area of the surface is larger. However, the trade-off we saw with simple machines still exists because a large movement on the small side only results in a small movement on the larger side. In practice, the small side is replaced by a pump system with valves so that you can always \"reload\" the small cylinder with more liquid to keep pressing the other side upward.  A pneumatic device works with the same concept, except that instead of a valve system, there's an air compressor that can increase the pressure inside of the system.  There are some important differences between the two technologies. Hydraulics use incompressible fluids, which means that the response is immediate and well-controlled. Pneumatics use air, which is compressible, so it's not as predictable. However, it's possible to store up air and transfer it into the system more easily than fluids, so you can often get a faster response with high enough pressures.    Applications of Hydraulics  Hydraulics are often used in heavy lifting applications. A simple hydraulic jack is powerful enough so that an entire car can be lifted by a single person (a lever also helps!). Also, a lot of car brakes are hydraulic. (Brake fluid... what do you think that fluid is doing?)    Applications of Pneumatics  Pneumatics are used in situations where you may want more speed or repetitive movement. It also has the benefit of only needing an air compressor to run, instead of specialized fluids (that can leak or be expensive to replace). A jackhammer is a common pneumatic tool where compressed air is used to drive it outward, and a spring mechanism is used to return the bit to its original position so that the process can repeat.   "

It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you don't understand it. You see my physics students don't understand it... That is because I don't understand it. Nobody does.   Richard Feynman (QED, The Strange Theory of Light and Matter)    It turns out that light is among the most complicated topics in physics to talk about. It is utterly unique in so many ways, and it defies many of our expectations for how we think the universe ought to work. If there is a single lesson to take away from this section, it's that all of the intuitive ideas that we will develop about light are wrong at some level. But unless you're a physicist doing research on light, the ways that our basic models are wrong aren't important enough to worry about.   electromagnetic radiation Light is electromagnetic radiation . Before the term radiation scares you, it's important to understand that everything in the universe that has a temperature above aboslute zero emits some form of electromagnetic radiation. The sun emits electromagnetic radiation, some of it that we can see and some of it we can't, such as ultraviolet radiation, which causes sun burns and skin cancer. Cell phones emit electromagnetic radiation, which is how they communicate with each other. You emit electromagnetic radiation, which is how night vision goggles can see you. And all light bulbs, regardless of the type (incandescent, fluorescent, or LED) emit electromagnetic radiation.   electromagnetic spectrum It might seem strange to say that you emit light, and that is because what we normally call \"light\" is electromagnetic radiation that our eyes can detect. However, in physics, we try to be more precise and call that \"visible light\" to avoid confusion. The reason for this is that the only difference between the radiation that our eyes can detect and the radiation that we need technology to detect is the amount of energy contained in that radiation. If we were to organize all of the types of electromagnetic radiation and order them by how much energy they each have, we would have a diagram known as the electromagnetic spectrum . Below is a diagram that labels the different energy levels.   photon  wave (light) There are two main ways to think about what light is. The first is that light is a photon , or a packet of energy. In this perspective, light is a particle. That means that it has a specific location that is traveling in a specific direction at a certain speed. In this framework, the energy of a photon is an intrinsic property that defines what type of light it is. Alternatively, we can think of light as a wave . In this perspective, we think of light traveling through the universe the way that a wave travels across water. The wave does not have a specific location, but is kind of spread out over a region. The wave may be moving in a specific direction and speed, but it's less clear what, exactly, is the thing that's moving.   wave-particle duality This mixed identity of light is often called wave-particle duality , which is a catchy-but-imprecise name that tries to capture the idea that a wave is somehow both of these things, while also being neither one. There is some history behind this, which is why the term sticks around. It turns out that physicists debated about whether light was a wave or a particle, with different scientists proposing different experiments to try to prove it one way or the other. Eventually, it was discovered that both sides could be right, depending on how the experiment was set up.  The importance of wave-particle duality is that it allows us to mix the two concepts together. For example, we often think of a photon as a ball of light that can bounce off of surfaces (reflect) in particle-like ways. At the same time, the way we perceive the color of light is based on the \"wavelength\" of light (the distance between consecutive peaks), which is a wave-like language to use. And we often don't think twice about it when we go back and forth like that.      (Space.com) What is the Electromagnetic Spectrum?      "

  "title": "Special Relativity",
  "body": " Special Relativity     -----   -----     special relativity (the theory of) Albert Einstein is known for developing a theory of light known as the theory of special relativity . Through a series of thought experiments, he deduced one of the most unusual quirks about light. Light always appears to be traveling the same speed, regardless of who is measuring it and the speed and direction they are going. Although the words that describe this phenomenon seem quite striaght-forward, the reality of this is utterly bizarre.   classical velocity addition To start to understand what this means, we need to do some simple thought experiments. Let's say that you have a gun that shoots a pellet at a speed of 20 miles per hour. And let's say that you're shooting this from a car that is traveling at 50 miles per hour. If you are shooting the gun forward, how fast will the pellet go (ignoring air resistance)? You would likely say that it's traveling at 70 miles per hour, 50 miles per hour from the car plus 20 miles per hour from the gun. This is know as classical velocity addition .  But light doesn't behave that way. If we replace the pellet with a photon, something unusual happens. The photon will always be traveling at the same speed, regardless of how fast the car is going. Even if the car were traveling at 99% of the speed of light, the photon will still be traveling the same speed.  The implications of this are quite surprising. Here are some examples:     time dilation Time appears to be moving slower for objects that are in motion. This is called time dilation .     length contraction Objects appear to be compressed in the direction of motion. This is called length contraction .     relativity of simultaneity If two events appear simultaneous for you, then they will not be simultaneous for a person in motion. This is known as the relativity of simultaneity .    We will do a thought experiment to understand the last of these. Suppose you are standing in the exact middle of a dark railroad car with a light bulb. If the light bulb is turned on, the light from the bulb will reach the front and the back of the car at the same time. This is because you are in the exact middle of the car. And this remains true if the car is moving along the tracks since your relative position between the front and the back stay the same.  But now suppose your friend is watching you go by, and the light is turned on at the exact moment you pass them. What will they see? Since the speed of light is not influenced by the speed of the train, he will see the light moving the same speed towards the front and back of the car. However, as time moves forward, the back of the car is moving towards the light and the front of the car is moving away from it. In other words, they won't see the light hitting the front and back at the same time, even though it was the same time for you.   classical velocity addition The formulas that describe all of this have an interesting property, which is that it is impossible to accelerate an object with mass to reach the speed of light. We're going to return to the pellet gun example, except that we're going to have a very powerful gun and a very powerful car. Let's suppose that the car is moving at half of the speed of light, and that the gun shoots at half of the speed of light. If we were to use classical velocity addition, we would say that the pellet must be moving at the speed of light. But this is impossible! It turns out that relativistic velocity addition is more complicated than that, and it results in a speed that is slower than classical velocity addition.

  "title": "The Speed of Light",
  "body": " The Speed of Light     Nothing travels faster than the speed of light, with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws.   Douglas Adams (Mostly Harmless)    We know that the speed of light is constant for all observers, but what is that constant? Today, we know the speed of light (which is denoted by the letter ) is exactly 299,792,458 meters per second (approximately meters per second), which is fast enough to go around the earth about 7.5 times in a single second. But the definition of a meter is defined by the speed of light, and so this is a circular definition. What we really want to think about is how people tried to determine this value before we knew what it was. The pursuit of the answer to this question is an interesting story of ingenuity and creativity. The challenge, of course, is that the speed of light is very, very fast. How do you even begin to measure such a thing?  The speed of light is so fast that it was assumed to be instantaneous all the way until the late 1600s. Galileo was among the first to postulate that perhaps the speed of light is finite, and even devised an experiment to try to measure it. The experiment was quite simple. Two people stand on opposite sides of a valley, and each one has a latern with a shutter that blocks the light. When both are ready and in position, one of them would remove the shutter and reveal the light to the other. When that person sees the light, they will open their shutter and reveal the light back to the first person. By measuring how long it took for the light to reach the first person, you could theoretically estimate how fast the light is traveling. However, when this experiment was conducted, it turned out that the time was the same regardless of the distances between the two people. In fact, what they were basically measuring was the reaction time for the preson to see the light and remove the shutter.  In 1676, the Danish astronomer Ole Christensen Rømer was the first person to get an actual estimate of the speed of light. This was based on observing the differences in the timing of the eclipses of the moons of Jupiter when the earth was approaching it and when the earth was moving away from it. Based on his calculations, he estimated that the speed of light was approximately meters per second. Even though the tools at the time were relatively crude, it is quite amazing that he was able to get the right order of magnitude for the speed of light at that time.   stellar aberration The next estimate for the speed of light was also derived from looking at the sky. There is a visual artifact called stellar aberration which makes the positions of stars shift slightly due to the movement of the earth around the sun. This can be understood by imagining a ball falling straight down from the sky. If you're standing still, you will see that the ball is falling vertically. But if you are walking towards the ball as it's falling, it will appear to be falling at an angle towards you. The English astronomer James Bradley was monitoring the position of a star called Eltanin and noticed that it moved in a way that the current theories did not correctly predict. Bradley theorized the concept of stellar aberration to explain this, and used it to estimate the speed of light to be approximately meters per second.  In 1849, the French physicist Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau used a mirror and a cogwheel to measure the speed of light without needing the night sky. His device shined a light through the teeth of a spinning cogwheel, which would hit a mirror about 8 kilometers away, which would return back. By spinning the wheel, he could create individual beams of light that would shoot down to the mirror and back again. Then by controlling the speed that the wheel was spinning at, he would be able to time it so that the beam of light would either hit a tooth of the cogwheel or hit a gap between the teeth. From this information, he was able to estimate that the speed of light to be about meters per second. While this was slightly worse, the major accomplishment was that this measured the speed of light using a very short distance (relatively speaking).  There were a more innovations, such as using rotating mirrors and using intereference of light waves that slowly improved the estimates for the speed of light. The science behind those methods gets increasingly complex, and so we're not going to delve any deeper into it. The main takeaway from this section is mostly to appreciate the progression of ideas that allowed us to get better and better approximations of the speed of light.

  "title": "Polarized Light",
  "body": " Polarized Light     -----   -----    If we think about the wave-like properties of light, we might start to wonder exactly what direction the waves are vibrating in. Our best analogy for thinking about waves is water, and in that situation the waves vibrate in the direction perpendicular to the wave's motion. That picture is somewhat limiting because there are really only two dimensions of motion, but it does give us the right concept. Light waves also vibrate perpendicular to its motion, but now it's a lot more complicated because there are many directions that this could be.   unpolarized light  polarized light The vibrations of light are typically oriented randomly. That is, each photon that arrives is vibrating in its own random direction, so that when you have lots of photons there is no coherence to the vibrations you are seeing. This is known as unpolarized light . Most of the light you encounter is unpolarized. It takes special conditions to get the light waves to become oriented in some type of meaningful pattern to become polarized light The most common types of polarized light in applications are linearly and circularly polarized light.   linearly polarized light  Linearly polarized light vibrates back and forth in a flat line pattern. This can be visualized as light that needs to pass through a series of parallel bars. Only the light that is aligned with the bars can make it through, and the rest of it gets blocked. And this is basically what a polarizing filters do. Our eyes cannot detect polarlized light directly, but we can test whether light is polarized by rotating a polarizing filter. If the light is polarized, the brightness will change depending on the angle. In fact, if all of the light is polarized, you will block all of the light if you hold the filter perpendicular to the polarization.  Polarized light can be formed off the reflection of surfaces, but only at certain angles (and the angle depends on the surface). In these situations, polarized filters can be used to block just the light off of that surface without blocking the rest of the light (which is typically unpolarized). This is why polarized sunglasses are able to reduce the glare off of the road and why polarized lenses can be used to reduce the glare off of water.   circularly polarized light  Circularly polarized light creates a spinning pattern, and it can be spinning either clockwise or counter-clockwise. To create circularly polarized light, you start with linearly polarized light and run it through a special filter that allows light to vibrate at two different speeds in two different (perpendicular) directions. But why would you want to convert linearly polarized light to circularly polarized light? Some electronics (TVs, monitors, smart phones) produce linearly polarized light, and research suggests that by adding an extra layer of polarizing filter to convert it to circularly polarized light, that it reduces eye strain.

  "body": " Color     Color is the place where our brain and the universe meet.   Paul Klee     visible light  Visible light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can detect. It turns out that this is a tiny sliver of the entire electromagnetic spectrum. We typically describe the photons in this range by their wavelengths, which span from approximately 380 to 700 nm. It is important to recognize that the cutoff is based on our biology, and not some larger physical principle. There are other creates in the animal world that can detect wavelengths that go outside of what we can see, and so their \"visible light\" would be a different range.   ROYGBIV The order of the colors from long to short wavelengths is typically described using the mnemonic ROYGBIV . This stands for the following colors (and their approximate range of wavelengths):    Red: 620 to 750 nm    Orange: 590 to 620 nm    Yellow: 570 to 590 nm    Green: 495 to 570 nm    Blue: 450 to 495 nm    Violet: 380 to 450 nm    You might notice that the I is missing. The letter I stands for indigo, and most people don't distinguish it as a color that's separate from blue or violet. It mostly remains for historical reasons, as this was how the color spectrum was first organized, and sometimes it's difficult to change something once it has been established.  None of these colors are \"real\" in the sense that there are no well-defined boundaries on these colors. In fact, what we perceive as color is a complex biological and psychological system for using our eyes and brains to differentiate between different wavelengths. While physics certain plays a role in bringing us color, our brains play a gigantic role in how we actually perceive it.   photoreceptors Basically, your eyes have two different photon detectors ( photoreceptors ), one for low light called rods, and one for bright light called cones. It turns out that cones are completely responsible for seeing colors, which explains why low light situations are typically experienced with a muted color range. (The light is low so only the rods get activated.) Among the cones, there are three different types of detectors, one for each of the colors red, green, and blue.  But how can we see so many colors if we only have receptors for three colors? Each color receptor is activated by a range of wavelengths, and not a single one. The colors are just the ones where each type reaches its peak level of activation. When we perceive other colors, it's because our brains are trying to interpret a mixed collection of signals. As the difference cones are activated to different levels, our brain comes up with a way of representing that activiation visually for us, and those are the colors that we see. One of the challenges of dealing with human color perception is that there is no guarantee that the way we perceive a color is the same way that someone else would perceive them. The easiest example of this to understand is the case of color blindness, where a person's brain is unable to distinguish between photons of different wavelengths that other people's brains are typically able to do.  So even though we will walk about colors as if they are concrete and specific objects, it's important to keep in mind that it's really much more complicated than that.

  "body": " Color Space     -----   -----   Color space is a topic that students of digital visual media need to understand. But it can often be a difficult topic because there are a lot of pieces that go into it. The goal of this section is to help you understand and interpret what color space is without getting too bogged down in the details.    The Perception of Color  In the previous section, we talked about how different wavelengths of light generate different colors. However, we did not say that every color that we see is the result of a particular wavelength of light. You will not find pink or brown in the rainbow. So where does it come from?   spectrophotometer A device known as a spectrophotometer can be used to measure the amounts of all of the incoming wavelengths of light. These can generate graphs (called the \"spectral power distribution\") that will show peaks around the wavelengths of light that are the most common when viewing an object. While we could say that these graphs can \"define\" colors for us, and this would be a very scientific and concrete way to understand colors, this isn't what actually happens in our heads. Our eyes are simply not as sophisticated, and we aren't able to isolate the exact wavelengths of lights in that way. All we have are our three colors of cones. This means that our understanding of color is going to be much simpler.  The solution our brains have developed is that it invents new colors for us to see when we're seeing mixtures of wavelengths at the same time in the same spot. So if the red and blue cones are being activated in the same spot, our brains create a color that we call magenta to try to tell us that this is a mixture of colors.  An important fact about our color perception is that it depends on the level of activation of the cones, and not the actual wavelengths of light that are hitting them. So we might perceive two colors to be the same even if the spectral power distributions are different.    The In-Between Layer  Imagine that you're watching a sunset. What is the physical process that's happening to allow you to experience it? The sun is generating photons, which are bouncing around all through the atmosphere and off of the ground, the clouds, the trees, and anything else that you see. Those photons then reach your eyes, which causes your brain to generate a picture that you interpret as watching the sunset.  Now imagine that you want to take a picture of this sunset so that you can see it again at some point in the future. This will introduce (at least) two more steps into the process. The first thing you need to do is to try to capture the photons (you do this with your camera), and then you need to find a way to reproduce those photons using a medium of some sort (your cell phone, your computer monitor, or your printer). We are going to focus on digital images because it presents a distinct set of challenges from analog images.  In this in-between layer, we create opportunities for errors to occur. Some of the errors are generated from things like an out-of-focus camera or corrupted data. But even if all of that were perfect, we still have a significant challenge. How do we capture reality and then reproduce it? The concept of color space is specifically focused on trying to figure out how to get colors as \"correct\" as possible.   photosite The challenge is that cameras, like our eyes, are limited in the information they can capture. They aren't capturing all of the information like a photospectrometer would. What is typically happening is that there is a sensor called a photosite which converts photons into voltages, which are converted to digital information. And then that digital information will need to be re-translated back into colors generated by a monitor, which can only generate three distinct colors with different levels of intensity. So the broad spectrum of photons that you started with gets boiled down to essentially three specific wavelengths, which somehow needs to capture our experience of color.    Color Space  Color space is our attempt to take what we can understand about human perception and do what we can to recreate as closely as possible an experience of reality within the limitations of the equipment that we have. The first thing we need to do is to chart our experience of colors. It starts with a graph that looks something like this:    Image taken from https:\/\/www.studiobinder.com\/blog\/what-is-color-space-definition   There are actually lots of graphs that can be generated, and they are all different ways of trying to conceptualize the same thing. The main features of each of these graphs are the following:    The boundary of the shape represents the visible light spectrum. In this specific example, the wavelengths are specifically indicated, but not all graphs will have this feature.    The colors that you see represent colors that are perceived. These colors are based on both theoretical and empirical data.    If we mix two wavelengths of light, we perceive a color that is somewhere on the line connecting them. Exactly where along the line it is depends on the relative intensity of the two wavelengths. In general, the perceived color is the weighted average of the wavelengths.      Gamuts  The purpose of color spaces is that provides us a framework for understanding how colors can be translated through the in-between layer.  On the recording end, we need to be able to understand and interpret the data we are collecting. If we had two color sensors where each one only detected a single wavelength of light, then the only colors that we would be able to record would be on the line connecting the two points on the boundary corresponding to those wavelengths. In other words, the color space that the camera could access is limited, and it will be unable to reproduce colors outside of that range. This example is mostly theoretical because modern technology doesn't have this type of limitation, but it is an important conceptual point to help understand the next part.  On the reproducing end, things are quite a bit more complicated. To keep our discussion as simple as possible, we will focus on RGB color schemes, which are used for electronic monitor displays (desktops, phones, tablets). These displays can really only create three distinct colors of light, namely red, green, and blue. But exactly which colors it generates depends on the specifics of how the electronics are set up. You might be familiar with trying to calibrate a monitor by turning the brightness up or down, or adjusting the contrast. Regardless of the specifics, there is a particular color of red, green, and blue that are generated, and those colors are located somewhere on thee color space. Once those three colors are identified, the only colors that can be displayed live inside of the triangle formed by those three points.  The goal is to have the colors collected by the recording end to be perfectly matched up with the colors generaeted on the reproducing end. And the only way this can happen is if there is agreement about what the colors are. And this is where the various standards came from. The following diagram shows three common color spaces:    Image taken from https:\/\/stephaniebryanphoto.com\/myblog\/understanding-color-space    gamut The triangles are known as gamuts , and they represent the range of colors that can be represented under the different color concepts, and this is based on the specific red, blue, and green that is used by that gamut. It also shows how using the wrong standard on your display relative to the camera can lead to poor results. For example, if your camera is set to Adobe RGB but your computer is set to interpret the data as sRGB, you will find that your greens are a little more yellow. This is because the camera's concept of green is more green than green of sRGB. And this is why it is important to make sure that you are using the same settings on both sides of the process.

  "title": "Kelvin Scale",
  "body": " Kelvin Scale     -----   -----     Blackbody Radiation  When we introduced the topic of photons and the electromagnetic spectrum, we stated that every object whose temperature is above zero emits radiation. This phenomenon is known as blackbody radiation . When we look at an object, there are two types of radiation that come from it. The most common type that we see is reflected light. An example of this is that sunlight hits the tree, and the tree reflects some of that light to our eyes so we can see it. But there's another type of radiation that comes from the object itself. The most common example of this that we see is a flame. The flame's light is coming from itself, not a reflection off of something else. Specifically, the light that we see is the blackbody radiation of tiny particles of soot. But what does that mean?  If we were to put a heated particle inside of a perfect vacuum, over time it will slowly release its energy in the form of photons. You can think of this as the sun slowly burning itself out in space. That release of energy in the form of photons that follow a specific mathematical formula that describes the spectral distribution, and the formula only depends on the temperature of the object (which is measured in Kelvin). In other words, you can know the temperature of a blackbody object by looking at what color it is.    The Kelvin Scale of Color  Since we have a mathematical model of the distribution of photons from blackbody radiation, and we have a model for what colors our brains create when we detect a range of photons, it's possible to roll the two concepts together into a graph. This graph shows us the color that we expect to see with our eyes based on the temperature of an object's blackbody radiation.    Image taken from https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/ba\/PlanckianLocus.png   Under this framework, lower temperatures tend to be more red and orange, and then the colors work their way up through yellows and whites, and if the temperature keeps rising it starts to tip into the blues. Note that this is the opposite direction of traditional \"color temperatures\" (where blue is cool and red is warm). The difference is mostly historical, as artists were describing colors long before the science of blackbody radiation was developed.  The most common application of the Kelvin scale of color is the color of lights. Here is an example of the color spectrum for different temperatures of light.

  "title": "RGB and CMYK",
  "body": " RGB and CMYK     To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, subtract things every day.   Lao Tzu   Within the media arts, there are two complementary color schemes that have been developed, and these are based on the underlying physics of how those colors are created. If you think about a computer monitor, the default state is black and colors are added in to make the screen brighter. If you think about a sheet of paper, the default state is white and colors are subtracted away to make the paper darker. This basic framework sets us up for understanding of the RGB and CYMK color schemes.    RGB   additive color RGB is the color scheme whose primary colors are red, green, and blue. The reason for this color combination is a matter of our human biology, and not some underlying physical principle. Our eyes simply have receptors that are mostly sensitive to those colors, and so this maximizes our responsiveness to this color scheme. Most importantly, this is an additive color scheme, which means that we are starting from black (no photons) and increasing the number of photons that reach our eyes when we add these colors into the mix.  If you were to take a very close look at your computer monitor or cellphone screen, you would see that each pixel is constructed from three subpixels. Unsurprisingly, the colors of those subpixels are red, green, and blue. The way that colors are produced is that those subpixels display at different levels of intensity. The itensity levels are usually given as a number from 0 to 255, where lower numbers mean lower levels of intensity. (If you have ever seen hex color codes, such as #A72EBD, you have seen this color system. The only difference is that the numbers are being represented in hexadecimal instead of using our usual decimal number system. If this were a math class, we'd talk about how hexadecmial works. But it's not, so we'll just direct you to search for a hexademical to decimal converter online.)   Technicolor The ideas for this system go back to the 1920s when Technicolor developed their three strip system. At that time, film was only able to capture black-and-white. How can you use black-and-white film to capture color? The basic idea was to capture the footage three times, with one film capturing the reds, one film capturing the greens, and one film capturing the blues. Then the three layers can be put back together using red, green, and blue lights to reproduce the original image.    CMYK  CMYK is the color scheme whose primary colors are cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. This is also built around human biology, but moving in the opposite direction as RGB. Instead of starting with black and turning up the colors, this starts with white and removes colors. This is used for pigment-based colors, like paint and ink, where the illumination source is external and the colors that are seen are only from reflected light.   subtractive color The reason a white piece of paper looks white is because it's reflecting red, green, and blue photons back at us. If we add red ink to the paper, the reason that we see red is because the ink is absorbing the green and blue photons, and is only reflecting back the red ones. And this is what is meant by subtractive color . However, when it comes to pigments, thinking in terms of red, green, and blue turns out to be more complicated when you mix them. The underlying reason for this is that generating red means absorbing green and blue, and it makes more sense to have the primary colors absorb single colors rather than pairs of colors.  And this is where we get the cyan, magenta, and yellow base colors. Cyan is the color you get when you absorb only red light. Magenta comes from absorbing green. Yellow is the result of absorbing blue. Then you can mix two of these colors together to get the secondary colors of red, green, and blue. For example, red is a mixture of magenta (which absorbs green) and yellow (which absorbs blue).  The role of black in this system is because there's a gap between theory and practice. In theory, if you mix cyan, magenta, and yellow together, you should get black. However, in practice, the pigments are not perfect. That is, cyan doesn't absorb all of the blue, and so on. This means that mixing the colors together usually results in a brown color. So adding black as a separate color sidesteps the challenge of needing to make perfect cyan, magenta, and yellow colors in order to mix them together to get black.

  "body": " Colored Lights and Shadows   Introduction  This lab is an exploration of colored lights and shadows. We will be playing around with different types of setups to help us understand what colors are being created and why.    Equipment List    Red, green, and blue flashlights    Plain white paper (whiter is better) for a \"wall\"    Index card, paper, or thin cardboard to cast shadows    A couple pencils or other similarly-shaped objects    Scissors    [Optional] Camera (photo or video) for capturing visual data.        Procedure  For this lab, we are going to start by using a set of red, blue, and green lights to get a white light. Then we will create shadows and various colors and try to understand the ways that lights are combining to create those colors.    Create a \"wall\" using the white paper. You need a place to shine your lights and create shadows. This could be a piece of paper leaning against a book or a binder, or even just folded in half. It only needs to stand a few inches tall.    Using the paper for the shadows, create two thin strips that are a few inches long and an inch wide. You will want a clean side edge where the two strips can be brought together like a curtain. The exact dimensions are not important. In one of the strips, create a slit that is about a quarter inch in width. Use the diagram below as a model.    Line up the three flashlights side-by-side pointing towards the wall. Make a note of which light is in which location.    Darken the room as much as possible and turn on the lights. (Note: If the flashlights have multiple settings, pick the brightest non-blinking option.) Position them so that they combine into a white light in the middle. There may be other colors on the edges, but we're not going to worry about that. From this point forward, you may want to take pictures or video of the lab for future reference.    Hold the strip of paper with the slit in it between the lights and the wall. You should see three lines of light of different colors if you move it close enough to the wall. Identify the colors and think about why the colors appear in the order that they do.    Hold the pencil between the lights and the wall. You should see three shadows of different colors. Identify the colors and think about why the colors are what they are. Then take the paper with the slit in it and place it between the pencil and the wall to create the three lines from before. Move the pencil so that its shadows cross the slit (one at a time) and make a note of your observations. Think about what is causing these outcomes.    Put two strips of paper end-to-end like a closed curtain and position them between the lights and the wall. Slowly separate the strips to reveal a thin slit. You should see three light lines similar to the paper with the slit. Continue pulling the papers apart and watch how the lines spread out. When the lines touch each other, make a note of the colors that are created. As they continue to get further apart, you will see a number of different color patterns. Make note of each one. You will eventually have just two sets of shadows, one from each piece of paper. Think about what is causing these outcomes.      Discussion  After you've completed the tasks, answer the following discussion questions. Some simple diagrams have been included to help you to explain your observations.    In the first phase, you created three lines of light. Explain why the lights appear in the order that they do.    In the first part of the second phase, you created a set of three colored shadows. Explain why you see the colors that you saw in the order that you saw them.    In the second part of the second phase, you created an interaction of three colored shadows with the slit. Explain the relationship between the color of the shadow and which line disappeared.    In the third phase, you created a sequence of several different color patterns. Draw them and explain how each color pattern was created.      Conclusion  As you went through this lab, you should have started to develop a stronger sense of how colors of light mix together. There is also a connection to be made between the additive and subtractive interpretation of colors. In the first phase, you were displaying the additive nature of light by allowing certain colors to shine through to the black shadow. In the second phase, you were displaying the subtractive nature of light by blocking certain colors from hitting the white wall. And in the third phase, you exhibited how the two perspectives are part of the same underlying reality of colors.    Lab Write-Up Guidance  Use the following outline to help you write up your lab report completely and correctly.    Title and Header  What is the title of the lab and who was in the lab group?    Introduction  In your own words, what was the purpose of the lab activity? You should be able to condense the core purpose to just a few sentences.    Equipment List  List the equipment that you actually used. Try to be clear in your description. For example, did you use a pen, pencil, or something else? How large were the papers you actually used? And what material were they (office paper, index cards, etc.)?    Procedure  Write down the steps that you executed. This should be similar to the given procedure, but it's possible you may have done something out of order, or perhaps you skipped something or did some additional experiments. The important thing is to just be sure you captured your actual activity.    Results and Data  Your information should be organized by the three phases of the lab activity. If you took photos or videos, this would be a good place to include those images. If you didn't, then you'll need to describe the results in words. Make sure to present the information in a way that is easy to understand. For example, avoid using a wall of text to describe something that might better be presented as a picture.    Discussion  Answer the questions in the discussion. Be sure to include diagrams that are helpful for explaining what's happening.    Conclusion  Write a paragraph or two that summarizes the lab and what you learned from it. You should reference additive and subtractive colors in some form. Be sure to include information about any particular moments of insight (or intrigue) that you had.         (color.nerd on TikTok) Color Theory with Shadows      "
