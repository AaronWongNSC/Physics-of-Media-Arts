  "body": " The Scientific Method(s)     The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind.   Thomas Henry Huxley    If you search around the internet for explanations of the scientific method, you'll find that there isn't an agreement on the steps. Here are a few examples:     Khan Academy's Introduction to Biology : (1) Make an observation; (2) Ask a question; (3) Form a hypothesis; (4) Make a prediction; (5) Test the prediction; (6) Iterate     University of Nevada Reno Extension's Fact Sheet on the Scientific Method : (1) Make an observation; (2) Define the problem; (3) Form a hypothesis; (4) Conduct the experiment; (5) Derive a theory     Your Dictionary's Article on the Scientific Method : (1) Define purpose; (2) Construct hypothesis; (3) Test hypothesis and collect data; (4) Analyze data; (5) Draw conclusion; (6) Communicate results    There are more examples in an article found in the CBE Life Sciences Education journal that explores the topic much more deeply and in the context of K-12 science education standards in Kansas from 2005.  So what's really happening here? Most science textbooks start off by teaching students the scientific method, as if there is one precise way to do science. One of the main reasons for this is to try to establish the concept of scientific rigor. By trying to put everything into a simple box, it is possible to portray science as the ultimate way to pursue what is true. Unfortunately, this representation is wrong from both a historical perspective and from a practical perspective. It is probably most correct to say that there are many scientific methods, and that those methods vary from one field of study to the next. How you might try to study physics is different from how you might try to study biology.  That said, it's not as if the ideas behind \"the\" scientific method are completely wrong. There is still value to having a general framework as a guidepost, even if it's not completely general or completely accurate in every context.  In this book, we are interested in trying to make the study of physics both practical and conceptual, but without getting too bogged down in unnecessary details. And trying to provide a precise formulation of the scientific is one of those unnecessary details. Instead, we will opt for a much more informal presentation of what the scientific method is.   scientific method (informal)  informal scientific method  An Informal Scientific Method   Scientific methodology is a two-step process of making observations and formulating ideas based on those observations. In many cases, the ideas that are formulated lead to the creation of experiments in order to generate additional observations that can be used to refine those ideas.    This two-step understanding of the scientific method is probably the simplest way to think about the process of doing science. If we go back to the examples of the scientific method found on the internet, we can see that the two steps of making observations and formulating ideas are well-represented. Throughout this book, we will be referring back to these two steps as part of how we try to advance our knowledge of physics.  More importantly, this framework helps to establish something that Thomas Huxley (the person quoted at the start of the section) was getting at with his ideas. Here's a longer quote from his essay \"On Our Knowledge of the Causes of the Phenomena of Organic Nature\":   The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind. It is simply the mode at which all phenomena are reasoned about, rendered precise and exact. There is no more difference, but there is just the same kind of difference, between the mental operations of a man of science and those of an ordinary person, as there is between the operations and methods of a baker or of a butcher weighing out his goods in common scales, and the operations of a chemist in performing a difficult and complex analysis by means of his balance and finely-graduated weights. It is not that the action of the scales in the one case, and the balance in the other, differ in the principles of their construction or manner of working; but the beam of one is set on an infinitely finer axis than the other, and of course turns by the addition of a much smaller weight.  You will understand this better, perhaps, if I give you some familiar example. You have all heard it repeated, I dare say, that men of science work by means of induction and deduction, and that by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of sense, wring from Nature certain other things, which are called natural laws, and causes, and that out of these, by some cunning skill of their own, they build up hypotheses and theories. And it is imagined by many, that the operations of the common mind can be by no means compared with these processes, and that they have to be acquired by a sort of special apprenticeship to the craft. To hear all these large words, you would think that the mind of a man of science must be constituted differently from that of his fellow men; but if you will not be frightened by terms, you will discover that you are quite wrong, and that all these terrible apparatus are being used by yourselves every day and every hour of your lives.   In other words, the idea he's putting forward is that scientific thinking is just regular thinking, but more refined. There is no \"magic\" in the scientific method that is reserved only for scientists doing real science. It's just a way of learning that is very similar to how people all over the world learn things. We pay attention to what's going on around us, we have ideas for what's happening, and then we see how those ideas play out in reality, and we allow that reality to refine our thinking a little bit more.

  "title": "Hypothesis, Theory, Law, and Models",
  "body": " Hypothesis, Theory, Law, and Models    In this house, we obey the laws of thermodynamics!   Homer Simpson   Another area of scientific thinking where it's possible to try to get unnecessarily rigorous is the distinction between hypotheses, theories, and laws. There is no underlying rule that allows us to classify each of these into neat groupings, and even the language itself is inconsistent. So this conversation ends up being more less accurate the more that we try to make it rigorous.  Typically, the word \"hypothesis\" is reserved for ideas we have that we are testing. For example, if we make a prediction about what is going to happen in a physics lab, we would typically call that idea a hypothesis. The whole point of making hypotheses is that it forces us to put our ideas into words that can be meaningfully tested for accuracy. After we make further observations (such as by running an experiment), we can then go back to those words and determine whether they were right or wrong (or at least mostly right or mostly wrong), and that leads us into the act of refining our ideas.  The words \"theory\" and \"law\" are actually much less precise. Some might try to talk about these as two different levels of knowledge and testability, where a \"theory\" is an idea that has been well-tested, but a \"law\" is so well-tested that we just don't ever expect it to be violated. However, this just isn't the case in physics.  For example, there's something known as \"Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation\" that is a formula that we can use to calculate the force of gravity between any two objects. The problem with this \"law\" is that it's not actually a law. The reason is that the law isn't perfectly correct. There are many observations we can make that would violate this law, such as looking at the orbits of planets around the sun. (If you measure things accurately enough, you would discover that the predictions are close, but not quite correct.)  There's also \"Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity\" which (among other things) establishes the idea that nothing can move faster than the speed of light. Up to this point, there are no known violations of this. And so it would seem we should call this a \"law\" instead of a theory. But the language around this is so deeply rooted in history that it's a change that will never happen.   model Ultimately, a better word for these is to call them \"models.\" A model is just a particular representation of a scientific idea. A model makes no declarations about what is \"true\" about the universe. It simply says that under a certain set of assumptions, we would expect the universe to behave in a certain way. Whether or not that happens in reality is an entirely different question. In physics, it's very common to be working in the framework of models instead of debating between theories and laws.  For example, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation gives us a formula for how much force we expect there to be between two massive objects, and it is known to be accurate when the masses aren't too large. But when the objects get larger, we may have to turn to Einstein's Theory of General Relativity to make better predictions.  Our approach to physics will be built around creating models for various situations. Those models will give us a theoretical foundation with which to analyze what might happen, and we will discuss things that can happen that will cause those models to fail.

  "body": " Physics Labs    The difference between screwing around and science is writing it down.   Adam Savage (Mythbusters)   Physics labs are simply a formal structure that give us opportunities to practice making observations and formulating ideas. In this book, we set them up in a very formal way because it's the best way to really slow down the process and allow deeper insights to settle in.  Your lab report should be understood as a completely self-contained document that describes what happened in the lab and what you learned from it. You should not assume that the person reading your lab report has access to the textbook or the lab procedures. All of that information must be included in your report. If the lab procedure has reflection questions, you should copy those questions into the appropriate section, and not just write down a number and your answers.  A carefully written lab report is much more than just presenting experimental data. It's a reflection of your ability to communicate the ideas that you have been asked to consider. It's also important to understand that not all labs work out perfectly, and sometimes you get results that are different than what is expected. Part of your job as a scientific thinker is to try to understand and explain discrepancies between the anticipated results and the actual results. In many cases, there is more to learn when something goes wrong compared to when everything goes right.  The following outline should be used for all lab activities:    Title and Header  This section is mostly for organization purposes. You should use the title that is stated in the lab procedures, but if you want to come up with a clever subtitle, you may certainly add one in. The remainder of the header information is the name of the group members. Typically, lab groups will be limited to three members, but your instructor may decide differently.    Introduction  This is where you state the overall objectives of the experiment. You will also want to include a discussion of the relevant concepts associated with the objectives. In a sense, you should think about this as the section that teaches the reader everything they need to know in order to understand the experiment you are about to run.    Equipment List  If the lab requires the use of specific pieces of equipment, these will be listed in this section to help with organization and preparation. This section is sometimes omitted if the lab doesn't need anything (other than perhaps some paper and a writing implement).    Procedure  This is where you explain the step-by-step procedure that you were meant to follow, and indications of any times that you deviated from that. This part should be detailed enough that someone else can follow the instructions to attempt to replicate your experiment. Your steps should be numbered, but your explanations of what happened should be written as paragraphs.    Results and Data  This section is where you record what happened. Typically, while you're actually running the experiment you'll be keeping your data recorded in a lab notebook or on other paper. When it comes to putting that data into a lab report, you are not simply copying over that information, but you are organizing it so that it is as legible and understandable as possible. This may mean that you put the data into tables and a graph, or maybe it's just a written description of observations at different times. This section also includes relevant calculations. This does not mean that you should include all of your scratch work. It should contain just the relevant calculations and a minimal amount of information or explanation (if needed) for what those calculations represent. It should not be a solid wall of formulas.    Discussion  This is where the heart of the report lives. All of the other work that you've done leads up to this section. Here is where you will respond to the questions that are contained in the lab. Your goal is to demonstrate that you've learned something from the observations you made while executing the lab. These questions should all revolve around the objectives that you presented in the introduction. When possible, you should make direct reference to the objectives for emphasis. In many cases, this may also include an error analysis, where you talk about the things that went wrong and how those things might be addressed if you were to do the experiment again.    Conclusion  Write a paragraph or two that summarizes the lab and what you learned from it.

  "body": " Becoming a Curious Thinker   Introduction  How well do you understand the world around you? The first lab activity is designed to cultivate a mind that is curious and willing to ask questions, even if they seem mundane. Because it turns out that the world is a fascinating place if you're willing to explore it.  We are going to visit a few different locations and engage in the practice of asking deep questions and trying to think about how we might get answers to those questions. In some situations, the answer might be to just search the internet for an explanation. But try to push beyond internet searches and think about how you might try to answer the question in other ways. Try to be clever and unorthodox, if you can.  Note that some questions will be dependent upon the specific context, and a general answer won't be good enough. In those cases, maybe the way to get an answer is to gather samples or data, and then maybe conduct some type of experiment. In some cases, you might not even know what types of experiments you could run to answer the question, in which case you might want to do a little background research on the internet to see if there are any easy answers. Ultimately, this activity is not about actually doing the research to get the answers, just the practice of asking the questions and taking the first steps towards starting the research.    Procedure  We are going to explore the following locations: the classroom, the building, the world outside of the building, and your home. At each location, we're going to complete the following steps:    Identify 5-7 objects in the space.    Pick 1 object to ask questions about.    Write down a list of at least 5 questions about it. (Feel free to ask more!)    Pick 3 of those questions and determine how you might go about finding the answer to those questions.      Bedroom Example    Location: Bedroom    Objects of Interest: Light switch, mattress, dresser, lamp, sheets, carpet, T-shirt    Questions about the light switch:    How does it work?    How much electricity flows through it?    What is it made of?    How is it manufactured?    Are there other types of light switches? What makes them different?    How easy is it to fix or repair a broken light switch?      Finding answers:    How does it work? -- There's probably a YouTube video that explains this. We could also try to take it apart and see if we can see the mechanism.    How much electricity flows through it? -- We would need a device that can be used to measure the amount of electricity. A quick internet search shows that such a device is called a \"multimeter\".    What is it made of? -- The outside appears to be a type of plastic, and there might be a kit that can be used to determine the type of plastic it is. But the inside part probably has some metal in it because electricity doesn't flow through plastic. We might have to use a different type of kit to test for different types of metals.        Parking Lot Example    Location: Parking Lot    Objects of Interest: Cars, trees, birds, dumpster, painted stripes    Questions about the cars:    How many cars are in the parking lot?    How many cars are normally in the parking lot?    How many cars does the parking lot hold?    What is the most common type of car in the parking lot?    How much does a car weigh?    How many cars are hybrid or electric?    How many of the cars are not locked?      Finding Answers:    How many cars are in the parking lot? -- We can try to count them, but cars might come and go while we're doing that. So maybe it's better to take a pictures of the parking lot and count from the photos. Having a drone might be useful because then we could take an overhead view of the parking lot.    How many cars are normally in the parking lot? -- We could count the number of cars at different times and then create a graph of the results. Or we can have someone monitor the entrances and exits to see when cars come and go and use that information to count the cars throughout the day.    How many of the cars are not locked? -- We could go through the parking lot and try to open the car doors and see how many of them open. [Note: Do NOT do this! We're just speculating on ways we can find the answer.] We can also observe people as they walk to the car to see how many of them need to unlock the car before getting in. We would have to be close enough to hear the car locks in case someone has keyless car entry.        Discussion  After you've completed the tasks, answer the following discussion questions:    Which location was it easiest to identify objects to ask questions about? And which location was it the most difficult? Why do you think that was the case?    What object was easiest to ask questions about? Were there any objects that you intentionally didn't pick because you thought it would be hard to come up with questions about it?    What was the most clever way you came up with for answering one of your questions? What did you think was clever about it?    Are there any questions that you actually want to know the answer to? If so, which ones? And why do you want to know?      Conclusion  As you went through the exercise, you should have found that some questions have answers that seem to be easily accessible, while others were complicated enough that you really need a lot of information to even begin the process of answering the question. The world we live in is extremely complex, and we take a lot of it for granted. And all it takes is a curious mind to begin to peel back the layers.    Lab Write-Up Guidance  Use the following outline to help you write up your lab report completely and correctly.    Title and Header  What is the title of the lab and who was in the lab group?    Introduction  In your own words, what was the purpose of the lab activity? This should only take a few sentences for this lab.    Procedure  This lab has you executing the same procedure in a few different locations. You do not need to write out the procedure multiple times. Find a nice way of organizing it so it's clear what you were expected to do.    Results and Data  For this lab, the results and data consist of lists and sentences. You can use the examples in the lab activity to give you some ideas for how to organize your work.    Discussion  Answer the discussion questions. Be sure that you state the original question and organize it in a way that is easy to follow.    Conclusion  Write a few sentences explaining your experience with the lab. Did you have any particularly clever thoughts, questions, or insights as you worked through the different settings?

  "title": "Calculators",
  "body": " Calculators     Calculators can only calculate - they cannot do mathematics.   John A. Van de Walle   One of the most basic tools of physics is the calculator. While it is certainly possible to do most of the calculations by hand, there's not a lot of value to that in the context of this course. But with that said, it puts an additional layer of importance for using your calculator correctly.  One of the challenges of this section is that there are many different types of calculators out there, and they don't all have the same set of features. In fact, not all calculators behave the same way, and it's possible for two calculators to give different results for the same button presses. Rather than going into the details of different brands, we're going to take a high level overview of calculators and develop some basic strategies for how to avoid errors, regardless of how your specific calculator works.    Order of Operations  One of the main errors (aside from pressing the wrong button) that can arise is when the desired calculation and the calculation that the calculator understands are not in alignment with each other. These are some of the most difficult errors to identify on the fly because your only indication that something went wrong is that the number is wrong. In some situations, the number you get is \"obviously\" wrong (such as getting a negative number when you know you should be getting a positive number). But the most common result is that a student dutifully copies the number the calculator gives them onto their paper, then moves forward from there without the slightest bit of hesitation.   order of operations Underneath this problem is an understanding of the order of operations . When used in the mathematical context, this is interpreted as PEMDAS (Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally) or BOMDAS, which is understood to be a set of rules for how to interpret a mathematical expression. More broadly, however, it just means the order in which you do things. For example, socks-before-shoes is an order of operations. The reason we need to think about this broader sense is because not all calculators understand the mathematical order of operations the way that it's set up in mathematics.  Consider the calculation . You would probably immediately recognize that you need to do the multiplication before the addition, and get the mathematically correct result of 7. But in order for you to know that, you had to see the whole problem before you strated. You had to know that the multiplication was at the end, and you used that information to determine how you were going to do the computation. Some calculators have this ability, but others do not.   immediate execution (calculator) Some calculators use the immediate execution method of computation. This means that it tries to do the calculation as you type it in. And even within this category, there are calculators that can hold values in memory and those that can't. Let's analyze how one of these calculators might see this calculation.     : The calculator understands that you're starting to type in a number. As long as you keep typing in digits, it will keep thinking that you're still typing in the number.     : You've now pressed a mathematical operation, so it knows that you're done with the first number. The next thing it is expecting is another number.     : Just as with the first step, as long as you're typing in numbers, it's waiting for you to finish telling it the number.     : At this point, things can go in one of two ways. Some calculators will understand that you're done with the second number of the sum and do that calculation right away. Then it will use that result with the multiplication that you're about to give it. On the other hand, some calculators know about the mathematical order of operations, and it will know that it needs to do this multiplication first, then go back and add the other result. But in order to do that, it will also need to hold that original 1 in memory.    While there is more to the calculation, this is the critical step where things can fall apart. And this is why it's critical for you to know how your calculator works. Lots of students get problems wrong because of something as simple as this.   infix notation (calculator) It's worth noting that there are some calculators that take the whole expression in before doing the calculation. These are sometimes called infix notation calculators. These behave more like how you would behave when looking at a calculation. You would use a logical system to determine which calculation needs to be performed first based on the order of operations, and then you would simplify from there. But infix notation also has order of operations pitfalls.  Consider the calculation . You can easily see that this is equal to 1. But if you don't type it into the calculator correctly, it won't give you the desired result. Here is the button sequences that students would typically press: . And some students might even see in the display and feel as though everything is correct. But how would the calculator see it?  The calculator is programmed to try to follow the order of operations, and so it will scan through the different operations to help it determine the order in which it will do the calculations. Based on this, it will see the division symbol and prioritize that one. This would lead to the first calculation being . This will be added to 3, giving 5.5 as the result.  The problem is now clear. You need to tell the calculator that the is all in the denominator for the division calculation. The way to do this is to use parentheses (which most infix calculators have). Once you type it as , it will give you the correct result.    A Basic Calculator Strategy  One of the best calculator strategies to develop is to get in the habit of only doing a few calculations at a time. As the expressions being evaluated become increasingly complex, the chances of making a mistake increase significantly. These errors can be as simple as pressing the wrong button (or failing to press a button) while typing in the calculation to errors related to the discussion above. As mentioned before, these are the types of errors that can be difficult to identify because you can hit the equal key and never realize that there was an error.  The technique is to use the order of operations to scan the expression for groups of calculations that can be executed together. In physics courses, this often reduces to one of two strategies: (1) Calculating the numerator and denominator of a fraction separately before taking the quotient; (2) Calculating all of the products before adding them together.  When you do this, you will need to write down the intermediate results. This is because you will need to reference the results you get in future calculations. This also provides you an opportunity to check your work by checking that you get a consistent result on the shorter calculations. It is generally good to keep at least 4 decimals in the middle of the calculation in order to avoid rounding errors. This is especially true for division calculations, where errors can quickly become magnified (typically when dividing by a small value).

  "title": "Scientific Notation",
  "body": " Scientific Notation     We are very very small. But we are profoundly capable of very very big things.   Stephen Hawking   Scientific notation is a way of representing numbers that are very large or very small in a way that helps us to work with and interpret the numbers much more easily. This is best exhibited by an example. Which number is larger: 705745422424033592 or 70574542424033591? As you try to compare the digits, you can start to see the difficulty of working with very large numbers in this form. If you were clever, you might have tried to count the number of digits in each number, and that's the basic insight of scientific notation.   scientific notation  standard notation  coefficient (scientific notation)  exponent (scientific notation) A number is in scientific notation if it is of the form , where and is an integer. We call the coefficient and the exponent . In contrast to scientific notation is standard notation , which is simply writing numbers the way we normally do.  A quick way to interpret a number in scientific notation is to look at the exponent. Numbers with positive exponents are typically \"big\" numbers and numbers with negative exponents are typically \"small\" numbers. The words \"big\" and \"small\" in quotes because we need to keep in mind that some of the work of the \"size\" consideration is being done by the units, and there's no absolute scale that we can use.   Standard Notation and Scientific Notation      Converting To and From Scientific Notation  The conversion to and from scientific notation follows from the fact that multiplying and dividing by 10 simply moves the decimal point to the left or to the right. However, we will want to avoid using the division symbol, so we will write division using negative exponents.   Multiplying and Dividing by 10    When converting a number from scientific notation to standard notation, the size of the exponent tells you how many places to move the decimal and the sign (positive or negative) of the exponent tells you which direction you need to move the decimal point. Positive exponents move the decimal to the right (it makes the number bigger) and negative exponents move the decimal to the left (it makes the number smaller). When you do this, you may need to insert zeros between the decimal point and the digits you started with as placeholders. We're using the fact that exponents represent repeated multiplication, so that (for example) multiplying by means multiplying by 10 three times, which would move the decimal three spaces to the right (one for each multiplication by 10).   From Scientific Notation to Standard Notation    When converting a number from standard notation to scientific notation, we will follow a mechanical process. To get the coefficient, think of the given number as string of digits without a decimal point, and put the decimal point to the right of the leading digit (the left-most non-zero digit) and drop all the unnecessary zeros. Then to determine the exponent, think about where the decimal point you created would need to go to get back the original number, and use the corresponding value.   From Standard Notation to Scientific Notation  Converting 1234000 to scientific notation:    Place the decimal to the right of the leading digit and drop the unnecessary zeros: 1.234    Determine how the decimal must move to restore the original number: 1.234 1234000 requires moving the decimal point 6 places to the right.    Write the number with the corresponding exponent:     Converting 0.000056789 to scientific notation:    Place the decimal to the right of the leading digit and drop the unnecessary zeros: 5.6789    Determine how the decimal must move to restore the original number: 5.6789 0.000056789 requires moving the decimal point 5 places to the left.    Write the number with the corresponding exponent:        Working with Exponents   exponents To work with scientific notation, you need to understand a few basic concepts about exponents . The first is that an exponent represents repeated multiplication. For example, . The second is that negative exponents represent a reciprocal, so that . Also notice that this works when the negative exponent is in the denominator, so that . Lastly, when you have a fraction involving exponents on the top and bottom of the fraction, you can cancel out pairs of terms (one on top and one on bottom).  There are some formulas that you can use for this, but the formulas tend to obscure the ideas, rather than adding clarity. So you will need to go out on the internet if you want to find and use the formulas. The examples will show you the logic, and if you understand the logic then you won't need the formulas.   Exponent Practice  Calculate .   Calculate .   Calculate .   Calculate .      Products and Quotients with Scientific Notation  Some calculators are capable of handling scientific notation. You would want to look for a button that has an EE or EXP on it, and you would want to find a tutorial (or experiment with the calculator) to make sure that you understand how to use it properly. But while you could use such a calculator to do your calculations, it is still important to understand the basic algebra that goes on behind it.  The key idea that we use is that when we have products and quotients (but not sums and differences), we can do the arithmetic in any order we want and still get the same answer. (Technically the last fact is a combination of two algebraic properties known as the commutative property and the associative property of multiplication.) The procedure we will follow is to multiply and\/or divide all of the coefficients and all of the exponent terms separately, and then combine the results in the end.   significant figures This is a good time to raise a point about significant figures. A system of significant figures represents a method for tracking the level of meaningful accuracy of the digits in a calculation. One of the great challenges in empirical work is that measurements are inherently imprecise. (We'll talk a little more about this in a later section.) If your digital scale might read 13 grams, but you won't really know whether the weight is closer to 12.6 grams or 13.4 grams. And so the 13 grams is actually just an estimate. When multiple values in a calculation are estimates, it can often be useful to keep track of the level of the estimate, and this is done through significant figures.  The general idea is that you can track significant figures in scientific notation by counting the number of decimal points there are in the representations and doing some bookkeeping with those values. For our purposes, we're going to skip this and just generally aim to keep at least 4 decimals. Although there are some useful ideas that can be developed in terms of really thinking through the concept of computational errors, it's a little bit off target for the big picture goals that we're looking for.

  "title": "Graphing Data",
  "body": " Graphing Data     -----   ----     Representing Two-Dimensional Data  Much of physics is about understanding the relationship between different variables. One of the ways we can identify such relationships is by graphing. While graphs may not be as precise as formulas, it gives us a language that we can use to try to understand certain types of relationships intuitively. We will specifically be focusing on the relationship between two variables, though many of these ideas can be extended to more variables.    Graphing Basics  A graph consists of points, lines, and curves plotted in a two-dimensional grid. Each direction represents a different variable. Points are named using the convention of an ordered pair , where the horizontal variable is listed first, followed by the vertical variable. Although the variables and were used in this example, we are not limited to that choice of variable. In many cases, we will have time on the horizontal axis, which is usually denoted with the variable .  There are two types of data that we will be working with: discrete and continuous. Discrete data means that we are picking specific values of the variables to plot. For example, we might be measuring the position of an object after 0 seconds, 1 second, 2 seconds, and 3 seconds. This leaves a gap of time where we don't have data. For example, we would have to guess the position of the object at 1.5 seconds. Continuous data means that the data does not have those gaps. Technically, any time we gather data we will have discrete data, but there are certainly situations where the data points are close enough that we treat the data as being practically continuous.   arrow paradox The challenge of continuous data has been explored from at least the time of the ancient Greeks. There is a thought experiment known as the Arrow Paradox that highlights the challenge of this. But we can think of this in terms of using a camera to film a moving object. Each frame of video captures a specific moment in time. But in each frame, the object is frozen in place. This means that in that moment, it doesn't make sense to say that the object is moving because it has specific location at that time. If we have a faster camera, we can capture more moments of time in the movement, but even then there's not a single moment where the motion is being captured, because each frame is still stationary. So there's no way to actually capture movement at any moment in time, and so if you have no movements at all moments of time, then how does anything actually move? (A modern physics resolution is that motion is not what happens at a specific moment in time, but what happens between the moments of time.)   Graphing Data  The first chart represents the height of a ball as it is dropped. The positions are captured with a digital camera capturing 4 frames per second. The data is then plotted in a graph.  INSERT IMAGE  The second chart represents the current measured across a circuit for various resistances. (The volatge is kept constant.) This data is then plotted in a graph.  INSERT IMAGE     interpolation  extrapolation  Interpolation and Extrapolation  When working with discrete data, there are two important concepts to understand for trying to interpret the graph. Interpolation is the process of estimating the values in between measured points in the data, and extrapolation is the process of estimating the values beyond the measured points in the data. Interpolation is often accomplished by using \"straight-line\" estimates, meaning that you imagine drawing a straight line between the data points and then using that line to estimate the values of the function.  Extrapolation is much more complicated. It requires a sense of how the function behaves. Using a straight line to estimate a function that is more parabolic can lead to significant errors. It can also lead to answers that do not make sense. This is a place where graphs give way to formulas and theoretical considerations. We will not encounter these types of situations too frequently in this course, but it's important to understand the idea.       (Google) Google      "

  "body": " Basic Algebra     -----   ----     Equations Represent Relationships  Although this is a course in conceptual physics, there will still be equations that you will need to navigate. However, we will not be doing many complicated algebraic manipulations. Instead, we will be focusing on the ideas that are hidden in the equations.  The main intuitive concept that you need to understand is how variables change relative to one another. Specifically, if you focus on just two variables, what happens if one of them gets larger? Does the other one also get larger, or does it become smaller? This will ultimately depend on where the variables are relative to each other in the equation. But there are some situations where your intuition will be enough to tell you the answer. For a fixed distance, the amount of time it takes to travel that distance goes down as your speed goes up.  A more precise version of this is identifying the algebraic relationship between the variables. This is where you get into the prototypical shapes of curves, such as a linear relationship, a quadratic relationship, an inverse relationship, or an inverse square relationship. (There are others, but these are the more common ones.)    Solving Equations  Although we won't be doing a lot with equations, we will still need to do some basic calculations with them. This is not meant to be a full general lesson on solving equations, but rather just an overview of the more common ways we will need to solve equations for this course. The general principle that we use is that whatever we do to one side of the equation, we must do to the other side of the equation. This keeps the equation (the relationship between the variables) in balance.  The only mathematical operations we will be using to solve equations in this class are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, and square roots. Typically, you will be given the values of all of the variables except for one, and the task will be to solve for the last one. You will need to pay attention to both the number and the units. Even if you're not entirely sure of what the units mean, you should be able to follow the algebra to get the correct results.   Solving Problems  The formula is the relationship between constant velocity ( ), time ( ), and distance ( ). Here are a couple typical problems for this equation and their solutions.  Problem 1: Suppose a car is traveling at 70 miles per hour for 3 hours. How far will it travel?    Notice that the problem gives us a velocity (70 miles per hour) and a time (3 hours), and the question is asking us about a distance (\"How far...?\"). The first step is to plug the values into the equation.     We will simplify the left side of the equation. Notice that the units of hours cancel out, leaving just the unit of miles. Also notice that the arithmetic that is indicated is to calculate , which gives 210.     In this case, the equation is already solved for , so there is nothing more to do. This means that the answer is that the car will travel 210 miles.    Problem 2: A person is running towards a door that closes in 5 seconds. They are 20 meters from the door. How fast must they run in order to get to the door before it closes?    This problem gives you time (5 seconds) and distance (20 meters), and you need to determine speed (\"How fast...?\"). We will plug these values into the equation.     There is no arithmetic to do in this equation, so we will go straight into solving. The velocity variable is being multiplied by 5 seconds, and so we must divide both sides by 5 seconds to undo that and isolate the velocity variable.     We will now simplify the fraction on the right side. Notice that the number part of the calculation is , which is 4. And there is no cancellation in the units. This gives us the following:     This tells us that if the person runs at a speed of 4 meters per second, they will reach the door just as it closes. This means that in order for them to get to the door before it closes, they must run faster than 4 meters per second.       Unit Conversions   conversion factor Unit conversions are a particular manipulation that is important to understand and execute. The main concept is that any relationship between two units can be expressed as a ratio that is equivalent to the number 1 (which is called a conversion factor ), and then multiplying any quantity by 1 does not change it. From here, it's just a matter of doing algebra on the units to complete the conversion  Creating a conversion factor simply requires us to write a relationship as an equation, and then writing a fraction with one side as the numerator and the other side as the denominator. The arrangement that you will want will depend on the calculation you are doing.   Creating Conversion Factors  Consider the relationship \"12 inches is a foot.\" If we were to write this as an equation, it would look like this: . This means that the two conversion factors we could create are and .  Another example would be the relationship \"60 seconds in a minute.\" The equation would be , so that the conversion factors are and .   To choose which conversion factor to use, you need to think about how you would cancel the units. It turns out that units cancel out like numbers and variables in fractions. This means setting up the fraction so that the unit you want to eliminate is on the opposite side of the fraction (numerator and denominator) of the original.  Once the conversion factor has been chosen, it is an exercise in multiplying by fractions to complete the calculation. You can treat the number parts independently of the units. If you are converting multiple units, you can either do them all at once, or do it one step at a time. If you are less confident with your mathematical skills, it's probably better to do one unit at a time. (Note: We treat the singular and plural of a unit to be the same thing, so that, for example, second would cancel with seconds.)   Single Unit Conversion Calculations  Suppose we wanted to convert 144 inches to feet. We would start by identifying the relationship . Then we would need to decide how to get the inches to cancel out. Since inches are currently in the numerator, we would want our conversion factor to have the inches in the denominator. That leads us to pick . The rest is just arithmetic and algebra.     Multiple Unit Conversion Calculations  Suppose we wanted to convert 10 kilometers per hour to meters per second. We would need two relationships. One to convert kilometers to meters, and another to convert hours to seconds. The first relationship is . (We will talk about the system of prefixes in the next chapter.) Perhaps you know how many seconds there are in an hour, but how would you do it if you didn't? This will require multiple conversions.  The two relevant relationships are that there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. We can see that seconds and hours can be related to each other through minutes. The key idea here is that we can multiply conversion factors together to get another conversion factor. Specifically, we have the following:   This conversion factor tells us that there are 3600 seconds in an hour. This gives us the second conversion factor we need. We will do the calculation in steps, and then do it all at once. We will first convert km\/hr to m\/hr.   Now we will convert m\/hr to m\/s.   Doing the calculation all at once looks like this:      Powers of Units  In some cases, you will see units raised to powers. The most common example of this is that area is in units of length squared, such as or . We will also encounter units such as squared seconds ( ). When doing a unit conversion of a unit raised to a power, you need to include a conversion factor for each power of the unit you see. The easiest way to think about this is to just write out the product of the units without an exponent and convert them one at a time.   Unit Conversion with Exponents  Suppose you wanted to know how many cubic inches there are in a cubic foot. We would need to use three conversion factors to convert each of the feet into inches.         (Foundations Textbook) Unit Conversions      "

The two relevant relationships are that there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. We can see that seconds and hours can be related to each other through minutes.

  "body": " Calculator Practice   Introduction  Math teachers used to tell students that they needed to learn their arithmetic because they wouldn't always have a calculator in their pocket. But it turns out that those teachers were wrong. However, this doesn't mean that everyone really understands how to use their calculator, or that every calculator is the same. This lab activity will have you use a number of different types of calculators and try to identify particular quirks that they may have.    Equipment List    At least two different cellphone calculators    Internet access to use following online calculators:     (TheOnlineCalculator.com) Basic Calculator      (Online-Calculator.com) Standard Calculator      (Desmos.com) Scientific Calculator         Procedure  We are going to investigate the calculators and learn about their individual quirks. You will want to take notes throughout so that you will be able to remember the information you need for the write-up.    Determine the following information about the two cellphone calculators and three online calculators:    Basic calculator information (cellphone calculators only): Determine the cell phone brand, calculator name, and calculator version. (Note: The calculator might just be called \"calculator.\" The version information might be difficult to find, but it's there somewhere. You might find the information in the app store.)    Calculator type: Basic or scientific. (Note: Some calculators allow you to use either mode. If so, indicate this and use scientific mode for the rest of the lab.)    Execution style: Infix or immediate execution    Parentheses, square, and square root: Determine whether the calculator allows the use of parentheses, the squaring function, and the square root function.    Scientific Notation: Determine whether the calculator accepts scientific notation. (Note: If the calculator is infix and has an exponentiation function, then you can use scientific notation. But some calculators will have an E or EE button for scientific notation.)      We will use the calculators to calculate some values. The purpose is to compare the relative difficulty of getting the correct answers. In some cases, you might be able to perform the entire calculation in a single step. But in other cases, you may need to perform multiple separate calculations to get the correct result. Be sure to make note of any challenges you encounter.    Calculate . The correct result is 10.    Calculate . The correct result is 7.    Calculate . The correct result is 7.      We will now calculate values using actual physics formulas with physically appropriate values. This will help us to see the types of challenges these calculators may face in actual practice. (Descriptions of the formulas are given, but it's okay if you don't understand them right now.)    FILL THIS IN AFTER COMPLETING MORE OF THE TEXT      We will now test some of the limits of the calculators. Perform the following tasks on each calculator.    Calculate and count the total number of digits that are displayed (including the leading zero). Then calculate and count the number of digits that are displayed. Indicate whether there are more, fewer, or the same number of digits in the display.    Determine the highest power of 10 that the calculator will accept without giving an error. This is easiest on calculators that have exponentiation or scientific notation. If it does not have these features, it will be helpful to use the \"Ans\" feature (uses the answer of the last calculation as part of the next calculation) or the memory feature to store large powers of ten. Make a note of the error it gives when it breaks.    If the calculator has a square root function, determine the maximum number of 9s needed for the calculator to display that . (Note: It is possible that for some calculators, it will not display this result even for a large number of 9s. If that happens on one of your calculators, just indicate this.)      We will now engage in some \"stress tests\" of the calculators. The goal is to see whether we can make the calculator make mistakes. Note that if the instruction says to \"calculate\" a quantity, it means to have the calculator evaluate the result by pressing the equal sign (or equivalent button).    Calculate . Do not add parentheses or make other adjustments to force the calculator to get the right answer. We want to see how the calculator interprets this. The correct answer is 7, but some calculators will give 9 as the answer.    Calculate and then multiply that result by . The correct answer is 1, but not all calculators will give this result.    Calculate with as many 9s are needed to give a result of 1. Then square the result. The correct answer is with as many 9s as you entered when you started. However, some calculators will have rounding error and simply return a value of 1.    For calculators with a squaring function and a square root function, start with and square as many times as needed to get a result of 0. Then take the square root. The correct answer is a very small positive one, but some calculators will give 0. For calculators that give a small positive number square twice and take the square root twice to see if it makes a difference. Continue squaring more and more times until it gets stuck at 0.    For calculators that have parentheses and inline notation (so that fractions appear as or instead of ), calculate . If the calculator does not give an error, indicate what answer it gave. (Note: This calculation is hotly debated on the internet, and it is known that different calculators give different answers. What the \"right\" answer is and whether there even a \"right\" answer depends on who you ask.)        Discussion  Answer the following questions.    Based on your experiences, which calculator would you say is the \"best\" one? The \"worst\" one? (Note: It's possible for multiple calculators to tie for best or worst. This is purely subjective.) What are your reasons for your rankings? Also indicate if there is disagreement within the group about these answers.    Did any of the stress test results surprise you? What about them was surprising?      Conclusion  It's a common assumption that everyone knows how to use a calculator. This assumption is true for very basic calculations, but it's often false when more complex calculations are involved. Was there anything new that you learned about calculators from this activity?    Lab Write-Up Guidance  Use the following outline to help you write up your lab report completely and correctly.    Title and Header  What is the title of the lab and who was in the lab group?    Introduction  In your own words, what was the purpose of the lab activity? This should only take a few sentences for this lab.    Procedure  This lab has you executing a number of calculations using different calculators. Describe the various calculations that you did.

  "body": " The Metric System is the Tool of the Devil!   Introduction     The metric system is the tool of the devil! My car gets forty rods to the hogshead, and that's the way I likes it!   Abraham Simpson (Grandpa Simpson)    imperial system While most of the world and all of science operates using the metric system, daily life in the US usually revolves around the imperial system of measurement. This is the system of quarts, gallons, feet, and miles that you're probably most accustomed to seeing. In fact, there are only three countries in the world that officially operate on the imperial system! (The other two countries are Liberia and Myanmar.)  The reason the imperial system is called that is because it was originally the system of units imposed on countries by the British Empire during the time of colonialism (imperial means \"of the empire\"). Somewhat confusingly, the imperial system wasn't formalized until the 1820s. Before that, there was a vast array of customary measures used in various locations, some of which date back to the 1500s (and potentially even earlier).  The actual origins of individual measurements were often rather arbitrary. For example, the length we call a foot today was originally the length of King Henry I's foot. And an inch has been defined muliple ways, including the length of three grains of barley laid end-to-end and the length of twelve poppy seeds. There are also other historical measurements that are similarly arbitrary, such as a cubit (the length from your elbow to the tip of your outstretched middle finger) and a league (the distance a person can walk in an hour). Of course, differences in individual human bodies made these measurements to be rough estimates at best. And the convoluted history and origins of these measurements have led to the equally convoluted relationships between them, such as 5280 feet in a mile.  For this lab, we are going to explore some more of the history of different units and practice making unit conversions using the imperial system.    Procedure  This lab consists of a lot of calculations. When doing your calculations, show the multiplication by the appropriate conversion factors and make sure that the units cancel appropriately.    As noted above, an inch has been interpreted as being the length of three grains of barley laid end-to-end and as the length of twelve poppy seeds. From this information, estimate the average length of a grain of barley and the average length of a poppy seed. (Use a three digit decimal approximation.)    Research the size of grains of barley and poppy seeds. How close are your calculations in the previous step to the values you found?    Sticking with the historical relationships, we can establish two length equalities: and . Use these relationships to perform the following unit conversions:    Convert 5 feet to poppy seeds.    Convert 12 yards to grains of barley.    Convert 2 miles to poppy seeds.    Convert 600 poppy seeds miles to grains of barley.      Another set of linear units were used for agricultural purposes. These are rods, chains, and furlongs. A chain is 4 rods, and a furlong is 10 chains. If you are familiar with horse racing, you probably know that there are 8 furlongs in a mile. From this information, determine the length of rods, chains, and furlongs in feet. Then perform the following unit conversions:    Convert 200 yards to chains.    Convert 100 feet to rods.    Convert 1 furlong to poppy seeds.      Liquid measurements often developed from commercial operations involving alcohol. You might know that both wine and whiskey are aged in barrels, but you might not know that the traditional sizes of the barrels are different for each beverage. Barrels are also related to other cask sizes, such as a hogshead and a tun. We are going to focus on the wine cask units, where a tun is 210 gallons, there are 4 hogsheads per tun, and 2 barrels per hogshead. Convert the quantities of barrels and hogsheads to gallons.    If Grandpa Simpson's car gets forty rods to the hogshead, how many miles per gallon is he getting? Is this good or bad? How many barley seeds per tun does he get?      Discussion  These questions will ask you to reflect on your experiences doing these calculations.    You calculated the number of poppy seeds in 2 miles. If you were to line up that many poppy seeds, do you expect the actual total length to be close to 2 miles? Why or why not?    It is likely that there was never a direct connection between the lengths of grains of barley and furlongs. Why do you think this is the case?    Do you think that the units of rods, chains, and furlongs is more or less \"logical\" than feet, inches, and miles? What features do you think make for a \"logical\" system of measurements?      Conclusion  This lab activity is mostly about practicing your unit conversions. Hopefully, you are more comfortable with them after having completed it.

  "title": "Numbers and Units",
  "body": " Numbers and Units    -----   ------   In order to explore physics, we need to work with numbers and units. So before we launch into physics, we have to spend a little bit of time understanding what those things are.  Here is a seemingly simple question: What is the number three? Yes, you can draw the arabic numeral 3 and say that this is 3. But that doesn't really get at the question, since there are lots of ways to write the number 3. We can also write three using a system of tally marks, or using numbers from a different language. Your next impulse might be to try gather three objects and say that these objects represent the number three. But is that true? How would we know from this that if we grabbed three other objects that those other things would also be three?  It turns out that the question of \"What is a number?\" is extremely complicated and can lead down rich paths of mathematical philosophy. For example, we can think about numbers in terms of their properties (numbers behave like this) or we can try to think about the \"essence\" of numbers (what makes a number a number and not something else?). And as you get deeper into the subject, you'll find that there is not a single simple answer to the question. (This is another example of how simple questions can lead to complicated answers.)  For our purposes, we will stick with the idea that numbers are symbols that represent a quantity or an amount. You might ask, \"A quantity or amount of what?\" And that's a good question to ask. Numbers don't tell us that. They just represent the abstract concept of quantity or amount. In order to know what sorts of things we have quantities of, we have to add a unit.   unit A unit is a word that represents a known quantity that represents a standard for a measurement. In casual contexts, the known quantity can be something simple like an apple. It makes sense for us to say that there are \"five apples\" on the table. However, from a more scientific perspective, an \"apple\" is not precise enough for us to use for our studies. What type of apples are they? And even if we have the same variety of apple (say, red delicious apples), they can be of many different weights and sizes. This makes for a very imprecise form of measurement.   Why are red delicious apples called that? If you've ever had them, they are perhaps among the least delicious apples that are out there! Apparently, they used to taste better, but over the years they have been bred for things like rotting slowly and not being easily bruised, and not bred for taste. Basically, the red delicious apple is a victim of modern capitalism.   When it comes to science, we have to use very precise quantities to avoid this type of variation. This will be the topic of the next section.  "

  "title": "SI Base Units",
  "body": " SI Base Units     I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it.   Lord Kelvin    SI  International Bureau of Weights and Measures The units used in modern science are known as SI units. SI stands for the \"International System of Units\" (from the French Système international d'unités ). These units were created by an organization called the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and is an agreed-upon standard that is officially used by almost every country in the world and the entirety of the modern scientific community. We are going to take a brief tour of a few of the units, which form the foundation for all other scientific units.    Seconds   second A second is a unit of time. Measuring the passage of time is something that we use in our daily lives and the second is the smallest common unit of time that we use for that purpose. But the technical definition of a second is somewhat surprising. The statement below is taken from the 9th edition of the \"SI brochure\" :   [The second] is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, , the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to .   What does this mean? Basically, it means that a second is defined by watching an atom and counting how quickly it bounces back and forth between two states. After about 9 billion of those transitions have occured, we say that a second has passed.  Historically, seconds have been a subdivision of a long unit of time. You would take a day, break it into 24 hours, break each hour into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds, and that would result in having a second be of a day. The problem with this definition is that a day is not a fixed unit of time. It turns out that the spin of the earth is decreasing at a rate of about 1.8 milliseconds every century (and this is only an average). This means that our measurements would be slowly shifting as well, and that's not what we want to see out of our science.  At a deeper level, it ties our concept of time to something that's not consistently measurable. If we were able to get a consistent and perfectly exact measurement of a day (and this time period is something that never changes), then we could theoretically tie our calculations to it. But we can't, and so scientists have tried to come up with something that they think would satisfy the requirements.   While this may seem random, we have used vibrations of quartz crystals to keep consistent time since the 1940s. And that was the start of the pathway that has taken us to where we are.     Meters   meter A meter is a unit of distance, and it is the distance that light travels in of a second. It turns out that this is about 39 inches, or a few inches longer than a yard. But why would this be the definition? It turns out that one of the laws of physics is that the speed of light is the same for all observers. This claim takes a bit to unpack, because it's a deeply unintuitive result that leads to all sorts of interesting consequences. So for now, we'll just say that the speed of light is a universal constant, which makes it a useful value for making measurements. The specific denominator of the fraction comes the speed of light being exactly 299,792,458 meters per second. And this also presents a chicken-and-egg problem. We use the speed of light to define a distance, but then we can't make sense of that distance that without measuring the speed of light.  Humans have been measuring distance for much longer than we have known the speed of light. And there were multiple iterations of the distance of a meter, but each of those were found to be imprecise. For example, an early definition of a meter was connected to the length of a particular pendulum to make it oscillate with a specific frequency, but that length turned out to be different in different locations (due to the fact that gravity changes with altitude). Another attempted meter was to define it to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator, but that measurement assumes the earth is smooth enough to make that meaningful. And while neither of those two methods were perfect, they did create an expectation for what a meter ought to be. And so the choice of declaring that the speed of light is exactly 299,792,458 meters per second was to create an integer value that also wouldn't significantly alter the existing meter.    Kilograms   kilogram  mass  weight  force A kilogram is a unit of mass. Mass is a somewhat complicated quantity to measure because it gets mixed up with a related but different concept of weight . The mass is basically the amount of matter in the object. If there's more mass in one object than another, it means that there's more matter in that object compared to the other. But how would we know how much matter there is? Our first intuition might be to weight it, and then we can say that there's more matter in the one that weighs more. This leads to the correct conclusion, but it's deceptive about the nature of matter.   gravity  intertia  International Space Station (ISS) You might be familiar with the idea that objects weigh less on the moon than they do on earth, and this is related to the concept of gravity . Since the gravity changes from one location to another, it makes it hard to really use gravity as the way to determine mass. In fact, if we were to put objects into orbit on the International Space Station (or ISS), we could not use weight at all since everything would weigh nothing! So a better concept of mass is to think about inertia , which is a measure of how hard it is to change the motion of something. Even though objects have no weight in space, it still takes a certain amount of effort to move them. Objects with more mass are harder to move than objects with less mass. And the difficulty of moving an object (not its weight) is what we should be thinking of when we think about mass.  You might have noticed that we haven't given the definition of a kilogram yet. That's because the definition is connected to a quantity known as Planck's constant . This is the number that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency. But to understand what that means, we would have to get into quantum mechanics, and that's just a lot to take in. So it's better to just hold the concept of mass without worrying about its formal definition.    The Other SI Units   ampere  kelvin  mole  candela There are four other SI units.     Ampere : A measure of electrical current     Kelvin : A measure of temperature     Mole : A measure of quantity     Candela : A measure of brightness of light    Each of these units have their own histories and complexities, but we will leave it as an exercise to explore that.

All of this helps to make these values mathematically easier to work with when performing unit conversions, especially when compared to the unit conversions of the imperial system.    What are the SI Prefixes?  SI prefixes are letters or words that are placed before a unit in order to modify its meaning. This gives us the ability to scale our units up or down so that the quantities we use in a particular setting are simpler. This is similar to other unit decisions, where we pick the unit to be convenient for the problem that we are attempting to solve or the the situation that we find ourselves in. For example, it's more sensible to talk about 2 kilometers of distance instead of 2,000,000 millimeters. Another way to think about this is that these prefixes allow us to \"hide\" some of the scientific notation in the units in order to simplify the communication of values.  Here is a chart of some of the SI prefixes:   SI Prefixes and Multipliers    Prefix  Symbol  Exponent Form  Standard Form    tera  T      giga  G      mega  M      kilo  k      hecto  h      deca  da      --  --      deci  d      centi  c      milli  m      micro  μ      nano  n      pico  p         How to Use the SI Prefixes  The prefixes allow you to easily relate values back to the base unit. For example, is equivalent to . Similarly, is equivalent to . However, if you're going from the base unit to the prefix, you will need to change the sign of the exponent. So is the same as and is equivalent to .  You can also create conversion factors by using two prefixes and the base unit. For example, to convert megavolts to millivolts, you would start with and simply replace both sides with the appropriate equivalent: . From here, it's just a matter of building the correct fraction for the desired outcome.  In these examples, we've used the full names of the units. But in practice, the units have abbreviations. For example, instead of writing \"volts\" we would just use \"V\". So a 5V batter is a \"5 volt\" battery. When using the abbreviated units, you also use the abbreviated symbol for the prefix. So \"MV\" is \"megavolt\" and \"mV\" is millivolt. Notice that the capitalization matters.       (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Metric (SI) Prefixes      "

  "body": " Derived Units    -----   -----   We can think of the SI units as the building blocks for more complicated concepts. For example, speed is the measure of how far an object travels in a particular amount of time. This means that we can't have speed unless we have both distance and time. The purpose of the SI base units is that it gives us the foundation upon which we can build all of the other physics concepts. Everything from here forward will involve some combination of those units.  Here are some examples of some physics concepts and their associated units:    Speed ( ): A measure of how far an object travels in a particular amount of time.    Acceleration ( ): A measure of the change of speed over a period of time.    Force ( ): A measure of the push or pull applied to an object.    Some of the units are given names to simplify the concepts. For example, the unit of force is a Newton, and it can be understood as the amount of force needed to accelerate a one kilogram mass at the the rate of one meter per second squared. There are also some concepts that have units that are easily calculated, but are extremely challenging to describe directly. For example, momentum is calculated as the product of mass and velocity, but what it measures might be described as the amount of stored motion within a mass.  It would be good to review for multiple unit conversions and unit conversions involving exponents.      (Wikipedia) Derived Units      "

  "title": "How Fast is That?",
  "body": " How Fast is That?   Introduction  It used to be difficult to take videos, but pretty much everyone has a video camera on their cellphone. Furthermore, most cellphones are even capable of slow motion videos (as fast as 240 frames per second), which is far more technology than what was available just a decade ago. We are going to take advantage of this to use cellphones to record video in order to calculate speeds. We can also use the stopwatch feature to capture even more data.    Equipment List    A cellphone capable of slow motion video    30 m (100 ft) tape measure    Cones or other markers that can be used to indicate the start and stop of a 25-meter track.    At least one of the following measuring boards:    4 ft x 8 ft plywood with stripes every 25 cm in the long direction (painted stripes, colored duct tape, etc.)    1\" x 6\" x 8 ft board with stripes every 25 cm (pained stripes, colored duct tape, etc.)      Tennis ball (or other ball that can be thrown safely)    Paper\/pen\/pencil to write down the times.      Procedure  The general task is to determine the speed of various objects by either using slow motion video or a stopwatch. The different tasks will be grouped by how they will be measured.    Mark out a 25-meter straight-line course and time the following behaviors with a stopwatch. Each person in the lab group should participate (if possible), and each measurement should be taken three times.    The time it takes for a person to cover the distance while walking at a \"normal\" pace (whatever feels natural to them).    The time it takes for a person to cover the distance starting from standing still and running as fast as they are comfortable. (Please take care not to injure yourself!)      Set up the measuring board in a safe area. Use the slow-motion video option on the cellphone to capture the object in motion. Your field of view for the camera should around twice as wide as the board. If you are too close, there will be too much distortion of distances due to the gap between the object and the board. If you are too far, you won't be able to see when the object clears the markings very well.    Throw a ball as fast as you can. It may take several attempts to capture usable footage. The ball should go past at about the same height as the measuring board. The goal is to get three successful attempts. (Try not to damage the phone or the person holding the phone!)    Run past the measuring board at your fastest comfortable speed. (In theory, this should be the same as the 25-meter run.) The measuring board should be about waist level, and you should try to focus on the same part of the body for each measurement.        Sample Charts   25-Meter Walk (in Seconds)      Walk #1  Walk #2  Walk #3  Average Walk    Student A    Student B    Student C      25-Meter Run (in Seconds)      Run #1  Run #2  Run #3  Average Run    Student A    Student B    Student C      25-cm Throw (in Frames)      Throw #1  Throw #2  Throw #3  Average Throw    Student A    Student B    Student C      25-cm Run (in Frames)      Run #1  Run #2  Run #3  Average Run    Student A    Student B    Student C       Discussion    Explain how you can convert the table of times for the 25-meter walk or run into speed in meters per second. Then convert the values to speed.    The average walking speed for an adult is typically between 1.2 and 1.4 m\/s, but there are lots of variables that contribute to this, such as age, height, and individual characteristics. Did anyone in the group walk faster or slower than typical? Was that person aware of this before this lab?    Determine the framerate for the camera that was used for the slow motion footage. How much time does one frame represent?    Convert the average frame count for ball throw into seconds, and then convert those values to speed in meters per second. Organize these values into a table. Which student has the fastest and slowest average speeds? Is there any relevant information that might explain why these individuals' are what they are?    Convert the average frame count for the run into seconds, and then convert those values to speed in meters per second. Organize these values into a table. Compare these results with the times attained from the 25-meter run. Explain why it should make sense that the 25-meter speed is slower than the 25-cm speed.      Conclusion  We have explored two methods of measuring speed in this lab. Both methods come down to directly measuring the amount of time required for an object to travel a specific distance, which is the basic definition of the concept of speed. And while speeds were the ultimate result of our calculations, the activity of the lab was more about making measurements. We measured out markers to indicate distances and we used different both a stopwatch and digital video to measure time.

  "title": "My Body is My Measuring Device",
  "body": " My Body is My Measuring Device   Introduction    Liberals get angry and tell us that the metric system is more \"rational\" than the measurements everyone understands. This is ridiculous. An inch is the width of a man's thumb, a foot the length of his foot, a yard the length of his belt. That's easy to visualize. How do you visualize 147.2 centimeters?   Ann Coulter   Ignoring the politics beind an op-ed that was written by a political firebrand in 2014, there's an interesting point about understanding measurements. All measurements are grounded in a history of trying to relate quantities to each other. In particular, lengths are historically related to lengths of things that people encounter all of the time, such as the length of an adult male foot or the size of a thumb. That said, these heuristic measurements are inaccurate because different people have different bodies.  This lab is about coming to understand your own body and learning how to estimate measurements with it. More specifically, you are going to develop metric intuition with your body. Familiarity with units comes with experience, and we're going to develop a set of experiences to help you become familiar with these values.    Equipment List    30-cm ruler    Meter stick    30 m (100 ft) tape measure    Cones or other markers that can be used to indicate positions on the ground    Tape    Paper and scissors    Objects and locations to measure.      Procedure  Every member of the group will perform a series of measurements to understand the dimensions of their body, and then practice making measurements with them.    Using the ruler, perform the following measurements:    Thumb width: Press your thumb onto the ruler to determine its width in cm. Note that different thumbs have different amounts of \"squishiness\" and so consistency of how you press your thumb matters. It works best to press you thumb in a way that \"feels natural\" to you. Don't try to \"remember\" how hard you have to press in order to achieve a certain dimension, because that's something you're unlikely to remember.    Hand span: Open your hand with your thumb and pinky finger spread out, and measure the distance from the tip of one to the tip of the other in cm. Just as with the thumb width, you want to do it in a way that is consistent, and whatever \"feels natural\" when you're doing this is probably the best option. You should not be trying to get the maximum possible distance.      Using the meter stick, perform the following measurements:    Cubit: A cubit is the distance from the tip of the elbow to the tip of the middle finger when the fingers are held straight out. Measure this directly on the meter stick. Give the result in cm.    Shoe length: Directly measure the length of your shoe. Give the result in cm.    Heel-to-toe step length: Using the meter stick, mark off a distance of 50 cm and 100 cm on the ground from a fixed starting point. Count the number of heel-to-toe steps that are needed to get to either the 50 cm mark or 100 cm mark. The mark you pick should be the one that ends the closest to an exact number of for your shoe size. It's likely that you will be \"just a little\" long or short. Try to estimate this to the quarter-shoe length. Give the result in cm.      Using the 30 meter tape measure, perform the following measurements:    Arm span: The arm span is the distance from finger tip to finger tip when both arms are held out to the side. This should be measurable directly, but it might be difficult to do by yourself. Give the result in meters.    Single step length: We will call a \"single step\" a step where you start with your feet side-by-side and take a single step forward, and then bringing your feet back to the side-by-side position. Using tape or other markings on the ground, create a starting line and line your toes up with it. Then take a single step and mark the final position of your feet. Then use those to measure your \"single step\" length. Give the result in meters    Pacing step length: A \"pacing step\" is a step that you make while walking normally. This is difficult to measure directly since you would need to focus on your feet a lot to get a good measurable step (starting in the right place and ending in a way that is easily measurable). Instead, we will take an average pacing step by walking out a measured distance and counting the steps. Using the cones, mark off a starting position, then a 20-meter mark, a 25-meter mark, and a 30 meter mark. From the starting position, walk as naturally as you can while counting your steps. Pick the mark that most accurately captures an exact number of steps and use that information to calculate your \"pacing step\" length. Give the result in meters.      Now that you have some measurements to work with, you will now practice using your body to measure various objects. Use multiple measurements where it's reasonable to do so. Be sure to indicate the measurement in terms of the method (arm span, etc.) and give the final estimate in either cm or m, depending on which is more appropriate.    Take a piece of regular office paper and try to cut a rectangle whose dimensions are 10 cm by 15 cm. Then measure the rectangles with a ruler, and write down the results.    Estimate the width and height of a doorway. (You may require a step stool or chair to reach the top of the doorway.) Write down the estimates, then measure it directly.    Estimate the length and width of a room. Write down the estimatse, then measure it directly.        Sample Charts   Hand and Arm Measurements      Thumb width (cm)  Hand Span (cm)  Cubit (cm)  Arm Span (m)    Student A    Student B    Student C      Foot Measurements      Shoe (cm)  Heel-to-Toe (cm)    Student A    Student B    Student C      Walking Measurements      Single Step  Pacing Step    Student A    Student B    Student C       Discussion    How effective were you in using your body as a measuring tool? Were the estimates close to the actual values?    How close were the shoe length measurement and heel-to-toe measurements? Were you surprised by this result? If they seemed somewhat different, is there an explanation for why you got this result?    How close were the single step and pacing step measurements? Were you surprised by this result? If they seemed somewhat different, is there an explanation for why you got this result?    Did anyone seem to get consistently long or short estimates? How could that be addressed so that they can get better results?      Conclusion  The use of the human body to make measurements is deeply grounded in history, and the results are grounded in experience. Although there is value to having standardized measurements and tools to make those measurements, it's not always the case that there is access to those tools. In those situations, it can be helpful to understand the size of your own body and use that to make estimates.    Lab Write-Up Guidance  Use the following outline to help you write up your lab report completely and correctly.    Title and Header  What is the title of the lab and who was in the lab group?    Introduction  In your own words, what was the purpose of the lab activity? This should only take a few sentences for this lab.    Procedure  Explain what the various measurements were and how they were taken. Then describe the estimations that you did.    Results and Data  Organize your measurements into charts such as the sample charts provided    Discussion  Answer the discussion questions. Be sure that you state the original question and organize it in a way that is easy to follow.    Conclusion  Write a couple paragraphs about the lab. Did you find anything interesting or surprising? Do you have any practical uses for your newly developed skill?     "

  "title": "What is Light?",
  "body": " What is Light?     What I am going to tell you about is what we teach our physics students in the third or fourth year of graduate school... It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you don't understand it. You see my physics students don't understand it... That is because I don't understand it. Nobody does.   Richard Feynman (QED, The Strange Theory of Light and Matter)    It turns out that light is among the most complicated topics in physics to talk about. It is utterly unique in so many ways, and it defies many of our expectations for how we think the universe ought to work. If there is a single lesson to take away from this section, it's that all of the intuitive ideas that we will develop about light are wrong at some level. But unless you're a physicist doing research on light, the ways that our basic models are wrong aren't important enough to worry about.   electromagnetic radiation Light is electromagnetic radiation . Before the term radiation scares you, it's important to understand that everything in the universe that has a temperature above aboslute zero emits some form of electromagnetic radiation. The sun emits electromagnetic radiation, some of it that we can see and some of it we can't, such as ultraviolet radiation, which causes sun burns and skin cancer. Cell phones emit electromagnetic radiation, which is how they communicate with each other. You emit electromagnetic radiation, which is how night vision goggles can see you. And all light bulbs, regardless of the type (incandescent, fluorescent, or LED) emit electromagnetic radiation.   electromagnetic spectrum It might seem strange to say that you emit light, and that is because what we normally call \"light\" is electromagnetic radiation that our eyes can detect. However, in physics, we try to be more precise and call that \"visible light\" to avoid confusion. The reason for this is that the only difference between the radiation that our eyes can detect and the radiation that we need technology to detect is the amount of energy contained in that radiation. If we were to organize all of the types of electromagnetic radiation and order them by how much energy they each have, we would have a diagram known as the electromagnetic spectrum . Below is a diagram that labels the different energy levels.   photon  wave (light) There are two main ways to think about what light is. The first is that light is a photon , or a packet of energy. In this perspective, light is a particle. That means that it has a specific location that is traveling in a specific direction at a certain speed. In this framework, the energy of a photon is an intrinsic property that defines what type of light it is. Alternatively, we can think of light as a wave . In this perspective, we think of light traveling through the universe the way that a wave travels across water. The wave does not have a specific location, but is kind of spread out over a region. The wave may be moving in a specific direction and speed, but it's less clear what, exactly, is the thing that's moving.   wave-particle duality This mixed identity of light is often called wave-particle duality , which is a catchy-but-imprecise name that tries to capture the idea that a wave is somehow both of these things, while also being neither one. There is some history behind this, which is why the term sticks around. It turns out that physicists debated about whether light was a wave or a particle, with different scientists proposing different experiments to try to prove it one way or the other. Eventually, it was discovered that both sides could be right, depending on how the experiment was set up.  The importance of wave-particle duality is that it allows us to mix the two concepts together. For example, we often think of a photon as a ball of light that can bounce off of surfaces (reflect) in particle-like ways. At the same time, the way we perceive the color of light is based on the \"wavelength\" of light (the distance between consecutive peaks), which is a wave-like language to use. And we often don't think twice about it when we go back and forth like that.      (Space.com) What is the Electromagnetic Spectrum?      "

  "title": "Special Relativity",
  "body": " Special Relativity     -----   -----     special relativity (the theory of) Albert Einstein is known for developing a theory of light known as the theory of special relativity . Through a series of thought experiments, he deduced one of the most unusual quirks about light. Light always appears to be traveling the same speed, regardless of who is measuring it and the speed and direction they are going. Although the words that describe this phenomenon seem quite striaght-forward, the reality of this is utterly bizarre.   classical velocity addition To start to understand what this means, we need to do some simple thought experiments. Let's say that you have a gun that shoots a pellet at a speed of 20 miles per hour. And let's say that you're shooting this from a car that is traveling at 50 miles per hour. If you are shooting the gun forward, how fast will the pellet go (ignoring air resistance)? You would likely say that it's traveling at 70 miles per hour, 50 miles per hour from the car plus 20 miles per hour from the gun. This is know as classical velocity addition .  But light doesn't behave that way. If we replace the pellet with a photon, something unusual happens. The photon will always be traveling at the same speed, regardless of how fast the car is going. Even if the car were traveling at 99% of the speed of light, the photon will still be traveling the same speed.  The implications of this are quite surprising. Here are some examples:     time dilation Time appears to be moving slower for objects that are in motion. This is called time dilation .     length contraction Objects appear to be compressed in the direction of motion. This is called length contraction .     relativity of simultaneity If two events appear simultaneous for you, then they will not be simultaneous for a person in motion. This is known as the relativity of simultaneity .    We will do a thought experiment to understand the last of these. Suppose you are standing in the exact middle of a dark railroad car with a light bulb. If the light bulb is turned on, the light from the bulb will reach the front and the back of the car at the same time. This is because you are in the exact middle of the car. And this remains true if the car is moving along the tracks since your relative position between the front and the back stay the same.  But now suppose your friend is watching you go by, and the light is turned on at the exact moment you pass them. What will they see? Since the speed of light is not influenced by the speed of the train, he will see the light moving the same speed towards the front and back of the car. However, as time moves forward, the back of the car is moving towards the light and the front of the car is moving away from it. In other words, they won't see the light hitting the front and back at the same time, even though it was the same time for you.   classical velocity addition The formulas that describe all of this have an interesting property, which is that it is impossible to accelerate an object with mass to reach the speed of light. We're going to return to the pellet gun example, except that we're going to have a very powerful gun and a very powerful car. Let's suppose that the car is moving at half of the speed of light, and that the gun shoots at half of the speed of light. If we were to use classical velocity addition, we would say that the pellet must be moving at the speed of light. But this is impossible! It turns out that relativistic velocity addition is more complicated than that, and it results in a speed that is slower than classical velocity addition.

  "title": "The Speed of Light",
  "body": " The Speed of Light     Nothing travels faster than the speed of light, with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws.   Douglas Adams (Mostly Harmless)    We know that the speed of light is constant for all observers, but what is that constant? Today, we know the speed of light (which is denoted by the letter ) is exactly 299,792,458 meters per second (approximately meters per second), which is fast enough to go around the earth about 7.5 times in a single second. But the definition of a meter is defined by the speed of light, and so this is a circular definition. What we really want to think about is how people tried to determine this value before we knew what it was. The pursuit of the answer to this question is an interesting story of ingenuity and creativity. The challenge, of course, is that the speed of light is very, very fast. How do you even begin to measure such a thing?  The speed of light is so fast that it was assumed to be instantaneous all the way until the late 1600s. Galileo was among the first to postulate that perhaps the speed of light is finite, and even devised an experiment to try to measure it. The experiment was quite simple. Two people stand on opposite sides of a valley, and each one has a latern with a shutter that blocks the light. When both are ready and in position, one of them would remove the shutter and reveal the light to the other. When that person sees the light, they will open their shutter and reveal the light back to the first person. By measuring how long it took for the light to reach the first person, you could theoretically estimate how fast the light is traveling. However, when this experiment was conducted, it turned out that the time was the same regardless of the distances between the two people. In fact, what they were basically measuring was the reaction time for the preson to see the light and remove the shutter.  In 1676, the Danish astronomer Ole Christensen Rømer was the first person to get an actual estimate of the speed of light. This was based on observing the differences in the timing of the eclipses of the moons of Jupiter when the earth was approaching it and when the earth was moving away from it. Based on his calculations, he estimated that the speed of light was approximately meters per second. Even though the tools at the time were relatively crude, it is quite amazing that he was able to get the right order of magnitude for the speed of light at that time.   stellar aberration The next estimate for the speed of light was also derived from looking at the sky. There is a visual artifact called stellar aberration which makes the positions of stars shift slightly due to the movement of the earth around the sun. This can be understood by imagining a ball falling straight down from the sky. If you're standing still, you will see that the ball is falling vertically. But if you are walking towards the ball as it's falling, it will appear to be falling at an angle towards you. The English astronomer James Bradley was monitoring the position of a star called Eltanin and noticed that it moved in a way that the current theories did not correctly predict. Bradley theorized the concept of stellar aberration to explain this, and used it to estimate the speed of light to be approximately meters per second.  In 1849, the French physicist Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau used a mirror and a cogwheel to measure the speed of light without needing the night sky. His device shined a light through the teeth of a spinning cogwheel, which would hit a mirror about 8 kilometers away, which would return back. By spinning the wheel, he could create individual beams of light that would shoot down to the mirror and back again. Then by controlling the speed that the wheel was spinning at, he would be able to time it so that the beam of light would either hit a tooth of the cogwheel or hit a gap between the teeth. From this information, he was able to estimate that the speed of light to be about meters per second. While this was slightly worse, the major accomplishment was that this measured the speed of light using a very short distance (relatively speaking).  There were a more innovations, such as using rotating mirrors and using intereference of light waves that slowly improved the estimates for the speed of light. The science behind those methods gets increasingly complex, and so we're not going to delve any deeper into it. The main takeaway from this section is mostly to appreciate the progression of ideas that allowed us to get better and better approximations of the speed of light.

  "title": "Polarized Light",
  "body": " Polarized Light     -----   -----    If we think about the wave-like properties of light, we might start to wonder exactly what direction the waves are vibrating in. Our best analogy for thinking about waves is water, and in that situation the waves vibrate in the direction perpendicular to the wave's motion. That picture is somewhat limiting because there are really only two dimensions of motion, but it does give us the right concept. Light waves also vibrate perpendicular to its motion, but now it's a lot more complicated because there are many directions that this could be.   unpolarized light  polarized light The vibrations of light are typically oriented randomly. That is, each photon that arrives is vibrating in its own random direction, so that when you have lots of photons there is no coherence to the vibrations you are seeing. This is known as unpolarized light . Most of the light you encounter is unpolarized. It takes special conditions to get the light waves to become oriented in some type of meaningful pattern to become polarized light The most common types of polarized light in applications are linearly and circularly polarized light.   linearly polarized light  Linearly polarized light vibrates back and forth in a flat line pattern. This can be visualized as light that needs to pass through a series of parallel bars. Only the light that is aligned with the bars can make it through, and the rest of it gets blocked. And this is basically what a polarizing filters do. Our eyes cannot detect polarlized light directly, but we can test whether light is polarized by rotating a polarizing filter. If the light is polarized, the brightness will change depending on the angle. In fact, if all of the light is polarized, you will block all of the light if you hold the filter perpendicular to the polarization.  Polarized light can be formed off the reflection of surfaces, but only at certain angles (and the angle depends on the surface). In these situations, polarized filters can be used to block just the light off of that surface without blocking the rest of the light (which is typically unpolarized). This is why polarized sunglasses are able to reduce the glare off of the road and why polarized lenses can be used to reduce the glare off of water.   circularly polarized light  Circularly polarized light creates a spinning pattern, and it can be spinning either clockwise or counter-clockwise. To create circularly polarized light, you start with linearly polarized light and run it through a special filter that allows light to vibrate at two different speeds in two different (perpendicular) directions. But why would you want to convert linearly polarized light to circularly polarized light? Some electronics (TVs, monitors, smart phones) produce linearly polarized light, and research suggests that by adding an extra layer of polarizing filter to convert it to circularly polarized light, that it reduces eye strain.

  "body": " Color     Color is the place where our brain and the universe meet.   Paul Klee     visible light  Visible light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can detect. It turns out that this is a tiny sliver of the entire electromagnetic spectrum. We typically describe the photons in this range by their wavelengths, which span from approximately 380 to 700 nm. It is important to recognize that the cutoff is based on our biology, and not some larger physical principle. There are other creates in the animal world that can detect wavelengths that go outside of what we can see, and so their \"visible light\" would be a different range.   ROYGBIV The order of the colors from long to short wavelengths is typically described using the mnemonic ROYGBIV . This stands for the following colors (and their approximate range of wavelengths):    Red: 620 to 750 nm    Orange: 590 to 620 nm    Yellow: 570 to 590 nm    Green: 495 to 570 nm    Blue: 450 to 495 nm    Violet: 380 to 450 nm    You might notice that the I is missing. The letter I stands for indigo, and most people don't distinguish it as a color that's separate from blue or violet. It mostly remains for historical reasons, as this was how the color spectrum was first organized, and sometimes it's difficult to change something once it has been established.  None of these colors are \"real\" in the sense that there are no well-defined boundaries on these colors. In fact, what we perceive as color is a complex biological and psychological system for using our eyes and brains to differentiate between different wavelengths. While physics certain plays a role in bringing us color, our brains play a gigantic role in how we actually perceive it.   photoreceptors Basically, your eyes have two different photon detectors ( photoreceptors ), one for low light called rods, and one for bright light called cones. It turns out that cones are completely responsible for seeing colors, which explains why low light situations are typically experienced with a muted color range. (The light is low so only the rods get activated.) Among the cones, there are three different types of detectors, one for each of the colors red, green, and blue.  But how can we see so many colors if we only have receptors for three colors? Each color receptor is activated by a range of wavelengths, and not a single one. The colors are just the ones where each type reaches its peak level of activation. When we perceive other colors, it's because our brains are trying to interpret a mixed collection of signals. As the difference cones are activated to different levels, our brain comes up with a way of representing that activiation visually for us, and those are the colors that we see. One of the challenges of dealing with human color perception is that there is no guarantee that the way we perceive a color is the same way that someone else would perceive them. The easiest example of this to understand is the case of color blindness, where a person's brain is unable to distinguish between photons of different wavelengths that other people's brains are typically able to do.  So even though we will walk about colors as if they are concrete and specific objects, it's important to keep in mind that it's really much more complicated than that.

  "body": " Color Space     -----   -----   Color space is a topic that students of digital visual media need to understand. But it can often be a difficult topic because there are a lot of pieces that go into it. The goal of this section is to help you understand and interpret what color space is without getting too bogged down in the details.    The Perception of Color  In the previous section, we talked about how different wavelengths of light generate different colors. However, we did not say that every color that we see is the result of a particular wavelength of light. You will not find pink or brown in the rainbow. So where does it come from?   spectrophotometer A device known as a spectrophotometer can be used to measure the amounts of all of the incoming wavelengths of light. These can generate graphs (called the \"spectral power distribution\") that will show peaks around the wavelengths of light that are the most common when viewing an object. While we could say that these graphs can \"define\" colors for us, and this would be a very scientific and concrete way to understand colors, this isn't what actually happens in our heads. Our eyes are simply not as sophisticated, and we aren't able to isolate the exact wavelengths of lights in that way. All we have are our three colors of cones. This means that our understanding of color is going to be much simpler.  The solution our brains have developed is that it invents new colors for us to see when we're seeing mixtures of wavelengths at the same time in the same spot. So if the red and blue cones are being activated in the same spot, our brains create a color that we call magenta to try to tell us that this is a mixture of colors.  An important fact about our color perception is that it depends on the level of activation of the cones, and not the actual wavelengths of light that are hitting them. So we might perceive two colors to be the same even if the spectral power distributions are different.    The In-Between Layer  Imagine that you're watching a sunset. What is the physical process that's happening to allow you to experience it? The sun is generating photons, which are bouncing around all through the atmosphere and off of the ground, the clouds, the trees, and anything else that you see. Those photons then reach your eyes, which causes your brain to generate a picture that you interpret as watching the sunset.  Now imagine that you want to take a picture of this sunset so that you can see it again at some point in the future. This will introduce (at least) two more steps into the process. The first thing you need to do is to try to capture the photons (you do this with your camera), and then you need to find a way to reproduce those photons using a medium of some sort (your cell phone, your computer monitor, or your printer). We are going to focus on digital images because it presents a distinct set of challenges from analog images.  In this in-between layer, we create opportunities for errors to occur. Some of the errors are generated from things like an out-of-focus camera or corrupted data. But even if all of that were perfect, we still have a significant challenge. How do we capture reality and then reproduce it? The concept of color space is specifically focused on trying to figure out how to get colors as \"correct\" as possible.   photosite The challenge is that cameras, like our eyes, are limited in the information they can capture. They aren't capturing all of the information like a photospectrometer would. What is typically happening is that there is a sensor called a photosite which converts photons into voltages, which are converted to digital information. And then that digital information will need to be re-translated back into colors generated by a monitor, which can only generate three distinct colors with different levels of intensity. So the broad spectrum of photons that you started with gets boiled down to essentially three specific wavelengths, which somehow needs to capture our experience of color.    Color Space  Color space is our attempt to take what we can understand about human perception and do what we can to recreate as closely as possible an experience of reality within the limitations of the equipment that we have. The first thing we need to do is to chart our experience of colors. It starts with a graph that looks something like this:    Image taken from https:\/\/www.studiobinder.com\/blog\/what-is-color-space-definition   There are actually lots of graphs that can be generated, and they are all different ways of trying to conceptualize the same thing. The main features of each of these graphs are the following:    The boundary of the shape represents the visible light spectrum. In this specific example, the wavelengths are specifically indicated, but not all graphs will have this feature.    The colors that you see represent colors that are perceived. These colors are based on both theoretical and empirical data.    If we mix two wavelengths of light, we perceive a color that is somewhere on the line connecting them. Exactly where along the line it is depends on the relative intensity of the two wavelengths. In general, the perceived color is the weighted average of the wavelengths.      Gamuts  The purpose of color spaces is that provides us a framework for understanding how colors can be translated through the in-between layer.  On the recording end, we need to be able to understand and interpret the data we are collecting. If we had two color sensors where each one only detected a single wavelength of light, then the only colors that we would be able to record would be on the line connecting the two points on the boundary corresponding to those wavelengths. In other words, the color space that the camera could access is limited, and it will be unable to reproduce colors outside of that range. This example is mostly theoretical because modern technology doesn't have this type of limitation, but it is an important conceptual point to help understand the next part.  On the reproducing end, things are quite a bit more complicated. To keep our discussion as simple as possible, we will focus on RGB color schemes, which are used for electronic monitor displays (desktops, phones, tablets). These displays can really only create three distinct colors of light, namely red, green, and blue. But exactly which colors it generates depends on the specifics of how the electronics are set up. You might be familiar with trying to calibrate a monitor by turning the brightness up or down, or adjusting the contrast. Regardless of the specifics, there is a particular color of red, green, and blue that are generated, and those colors are located somewhere on thee color space. Once those three colors are identified, the only colors that can be displayed live inside of the triangle formed by those three points.  The goal is to have the colors collected by the recording end to be perfectly matched up with the colors generaeted on the reproducing end. And the only way this can happen is if there is agreement about what the colors are. And this is where the various standards came from. The following diagram shows three common color spaces:    Image taken from https:\/\/stephaniebryanphoto.com\/myblog\/understanding-color-space    gamut The triangles are known as gamuts , and they represent the range of colors that can be represented under the different color concepts, and this is based on the specific red, blue, and green that is used by that gamut. It also shows how using the wrong standard on your display relative to the camera can lead to poor results. For example, if your camera is set to Adobe RGB but your computer is set to interpret the data as sRGB, you will find that your greens are a little more yellow. This is because the camera's concept of green is more green than green of sRGB. And this is why it is important to make sure that you are using the same settings on both sides of the process.

  "body": " Kelvin Scale     -----   -----     Blackbody Radiation  When we introduced the topic of photons and the electromagnetic spectrum, we stated that every object whose temperature is above zero emits radiation. This phenomenon is known as blackbody radiation . When we look at an object, there are two types of radiation that come from it. The most common type that we see is reflected light. An example of this is that sunlight hits the tree, and the tree reflects some of that light to our eyes so we can see it. But there's another type of radiation that comes from the object itself. The most common example of this that we see is a flame. The flame's light is coming from itself, not a reflection off of something else. Specifically, the light that we see is the blackbody radiation of tiny particles of soot. But what does that mean?  If we were to put a heated particle inside of a perfect vacuum, over time it will slowly release its energy in the form of photons. You can think of this as the sun slowly burning itself out in space. That release of energy in the form of photons that follow a specific mathematical formula that describes the spectral distribution, and the formula only depends on the temperature of the object (which is measured in Kelvin). In other words, you can know the temperature of a blackbody object by looking at what color it is.    The Kelvin Scale of Color  Since we have a mathematical model of the distribution of photons from blackbody radiation, and we have a model for what colors our brains create when we detect a range of photons, it's possible to roll the two concepts together into a graph. This graph shows us the color that we expect to see with our eyes based on the temperature of an object's blackbody radiation.    Image taken from https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/ba\/PlanckianLocus.png   Under this framework, lower temperatures tend to be more red and orange, and then the colors work their way up through yellows and whites, and if the temperature keeps rising it starts to tip into the blues. Note that this is the opposite direction of traditional \"color temperatures\" (where blue is cool and red is warm). The difference is mostly historical, as artists were describing colors long before the science of blackbody radiation was developed.  The most common application of the Kelvin scale of color is the color of lights. Here is an example of the color spectrum for different temperatures of light.

  "title": "RGB and CMYK",
  "body": " RGB and CMYK     To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, subtract things every day.   Lao Tzu   Within the media arts, there are two complementary color schemes that have been developed, and these are based on the underlying physics of how those colors are created. If you think about a computer monitor, the default state is black and colors are added in to make the screen brighter. If you think about a sheet of paper, the default state is white and colors are subtracted away to make the paper darker. This basic framework sets us up for understanding of the RGB and CYMK color schemes.    RGB   additive color RGB is the color scheme whose primary colors are red, green, and blue. The reason for this color combination is a matter of our human biology, and not some underlying physical principle. Our eyes simply have receptors that are mostly sensitive to those colors, and so this maximizes our responsiveness to this color scheme. Most importantly, this is an additive color scheme, which means that we are starting from black (no photons) and increasing the number of photons that reach our eyes when we add these colors into the mix.  If you were to take a very close look at your computer monitor or cellphone screen, you would see that each pixel is constructed from three subpixels. Unsurprisingly, the colors of those subpixels are red, green, and blue. The way that colors are produced is that those subpixels display at different levels of intensity. The itensity levels are usually given as a number from 0 to 255, where lower numbers mean lower levels of intensity. (If you have ever seen hex color codes, such as #A72EBD, you have seen this color system. The only difference is that the numbers are being represented in hexadecimal instead of using our usual decimal number system. If this were a math class, we'd talk about how hexadecmial works. But it's not, so we'll just direct you to search for a hexademical to decimal converter online.)   Technicolor The ideas for this system go back to the 1920s when Technicolor developed their three strip system. At that time, film was only able to capture black-and-white. How can you use black-and-white film to capture color? The basic idea was to capture the footage three times, with one film capturing the reds, one film capturing the greens, and one film capturing the blues. Then the three layers can be put back together using red, green, and blue lights to reproduce the original image.    CMYK  CMYK is the color scheme whose primary colors are cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. This is also built around human biology, but moving in the opposite direction as RGB. Instead of starting with black and turning up the colors, this starts with white and removes colors. This is used for pigment-based colors, like paint and ink, where the illumination source is external and the colors that are seen are only from reflected light.   subtractive color The reason a white piece of paper looks white is because it's reflecting red, green, and blue photons back at us. If we add red ink to the paper, the reason that we see red is because the ink is absorbing the green and blue photons, and is only reflecting back the red ones. And this is what is meant by subtractive color . However, when it comes to pigments, thinking in terms of red, green, and blue turns out to be more complicated when you mix them. The underlying reason for this is that generating red means absorbing green and blue, and it makes more sense to have the primary colors absorb single colors rather than pairs of colors.  And this is where we get the cyan, magenta, and yellow base colors. Cyan is the color you get when you absorb only red light. Magenta comes from absorbing green. Yellow is the result of absorbing blue. Then you can mix two of these colors together to get the secondary colors of red, green, and blue. For example, red is a mixture of magenta (which absorbs green) and yellow (which absorbs blue).  The role of black in this system is because there's a gap between theory and practice. In theory, if you mix cyan, magenta, and yellow together, you should get black. However, in practice, the pigments are not perfect. That is, cyan doesn't absorb all of the blue, and so on. This means that mixing the colors together usually results in a brown color. So adding black as a separate color sidesteps the challenge of needing to make perfect cyan, magenta, and yellow colors in order to mix them together to get black.

  "body": " Colored Lights and Shadows   Introduction  This lab is an exploration of colored lights and shadows. We will be playing around with different types of setups to help us understand what colors are being created and why.    Equipment List    Red, green, and blue flashlights    Plain white paper (whiter is better) for a \"wall\"    Index card, paper, or thin cardboard to cast shadows    A couple pencils or other similarly-shaped objects    Scissors    [Optional] Camera (photo or video) for capturing visual data.        Procedure  For this lab, we are going to start by using a set of red, blue, and green lights to get a white light. Then we will create shadows and various colors and try to understand the ways that lights are combining to create those colors.    Create a \"wall\" using the white paper. You need a place to shine your lights and create shadows. This could be a piece of paper leaning against a book or a binder, or even just folded in half. It only needs to stand a few inches tall.    Using the paper for the shadows, create two thin strips that are a few inches long and an inch wide. You will want a clean side edge where the two strips can be brought together like a curtain. The exact dimensions are not important. In one of the strips, create a slit that is about a quarter inch in width. Use the diagram below as a model.    Line up the three flashlights side-by-side pointing towards the wall. Make a note of which light is in which location.    Darken the room as much as possible and turn on the lights. (Note: If the flashlights have multiple settings, pick the brightest non-blinking option.) Position them so that they combine into a white light in the middle. There may be other colors on the edges, but we're not going to worry about that. From this point forward, you may want to take pictures or video of the lab for future reference.    Hold the strip of paper with the slit in it between the lights and the wall. You should see three lines of light of different colors if you move it close enough to the wall. Identify the colors and think about why the colors appear in the order that they do.    Hold the pencil between the lights and the wall. You should see three shadows of different colors. Identify the colors and think about why the colors are what they are. Then take the paper with the slit in it and place it between the pencil and the wall to create the three lines from before. Move the pencil so that its shadows cross the slit (one at a time) and make a note of your observations. Think about what is causing these outcomes.    Put two strips of paper end-to-end like a closed curtain and position them between the lights and the wall. Slowly separate the strips to reveal a thin slit. You should see three light lines similar to the paper with the slit. Continue pulling the papers apart and watch how the lines spread out. When the lines touch each other, make a note of the colors that are created. As they continue to get further apart, you will see a number of different color patterns. Make note of each one. You will eventually have just two sets of shadows, one from each piece of paper. Think about what is causing these outcomes.      Discussion  After you've completed the tasks, answer the following discussion questions. Some simple diagrams have been included to help you to explain your observations.    In the first phase, you created three lines of light. Explain why the lights appear in the order that they do.    In the first part of the second phase, you created a set of three colored shadows. Explain why you see the colors that you saw in the order that you saw them.    In the second part of the second phase, you created an interaction of three colored shadows with the slit. Explain the relationship between the color of the shadow and which line disappeared.    In the third phase, you created a sequence of several different color patterns. Draw them and explain how each color pattern was created.      Conclusion  As you went through this lab, you should have started to develop a stronger sense of how colors of light mix together. There is also a connection to be made between the additive and subtractive interpretation of colors. In the first phase, you were displaying the additive nature of light by allowing certain colors to shine through to the black shadow. In the second phase, you were displaying the subtractive nature of light by blocking certain colors from hitting the white wall. And in the third phase, you exhibited how the two perspectives are part of the same underlying reality of colors.    Lab Write-Up Guidance  Use the following outline to help you write up your lab report completely and correctly.    Title and Header  What is the title of the lab and who was in the lab group?    Introduction  In your own words, what was the purpose of the lab activity? You should be able to condense the core purpose to just a few sentences.    Equipment List  List the equipment that you actually used. Try to be clear in your description. For example, did you use a pen, pencil, or something else? How large were the papers you actually used? And what material were they (office paper, index cards, etc.)?    Procedure  Write down the steps that you executed. This should be similar to the given procedure, but it's possible you may have done something out of order, or perhaps you skipped something or did some additional experiments. The important thing is to just be sure you captured your actual activity.    Results and Data  Your information should be organized by the three phases of the lab activity. If you took photos or videos, this would be a good place to include those images. If you didn't, then you'll need to describe the results in words. Make sure to present the information in a way that is easy to understand. For example, avoid using a wall of text to describe something that might better be presented as a picture.    Discussion  Answer the questions in the discussion. Be sure to include diagrams that are helpful for explaining what's happening.    Conclusion  Write a paragraph or two that summarizes the lab and what you learned from it. You should reference additive and subtractive colors in some form. Be sure to include information about any particular moments of insight (or intrigue) that you had.         (color.nerd on TikTok) Color Theory with Shadows      "
