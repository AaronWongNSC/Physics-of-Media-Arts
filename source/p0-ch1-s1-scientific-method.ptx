    If you search around the internet for explanations of the scientific method, you'll find that there isn't an agreement
    on the steps. Here are a few examples:

    There are more examples in an <url href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1635141/">article</url> found in the
    <url href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/journals/421/">CBE Life Sciences Education</url> journal that explores the topic much
    more deeply and in the context of K-12 science education standards in Kansas from 2005.

    So what's really happening here? Most science textbooks start off by teaching students the scientific method, as if there is
    one precise way to do science. One of the main reasons for this is to try to establish the concept of scientific rigor. By
    trying to put everything into a simple box, it is possible to portray science as the ultimate way to pursue
    what is true. Unfortunately, this representation is wrong from both a historical perspective and from a
    practical perspective. It is probably most correct to say that there are many scientific methods, and that
    those methods vary from one field of study to the next. How you might try to study physics is different from how
    you might try to study biology.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, it's not as if the ideas behind "the" scientific method are completely wrong. There is still value
    to having a general framework as a guidepost, even if it's not completely general or completely accurate in
    every context.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this book, we are interested in trying to make the study of physics both practical and conceptual, but without getting too
    bogged down in unnecessary details. And trying to provide a precise formulation of the scientific is one of those
    unnecessary details. Instead, we will opt for a much more informal presentation of what the scientific method is.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <title>An Informal Scientific Method</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Scientific methodology is a two-step process of making observations and formulating ideas based on those observations. In many
        cases, the ideas that are formulate lead to the creation of experiments in order to generate additional observations that can
        be used to refine the ideas that have been formulated.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This two-step understanding of the scientific method is probably the simplest way to think about the process of doing science. If we
    go back to the examples of the scientific method found on the internet, we can see that the two steps of making observations and
    formulating ideas are well-represented. Throughout this book, we will be referring back to these two steps as part of how we try to
    advance our knowledge of physics.
  </p>

    More importantly, this framework helps to establish something that Thomas Huxley (the person quoted at the start of the section) was
    getting at with his ideas. Here's a longer quote from his essay "On Our Knowledge of the Causes of the Phenomena of Organic Nature":
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind. It is simply
      the mode at which all phenomena are reasoned about, rendered precise and exact. There is no more difference, but there is just the
      same kind of difference, between the mental operations of a man of science and those of an ordinary person, as there is between the
      operations and methods of a baker or of a butcher weighing out his goods in common scales, and the operations of a chemist in performing
      a difficult and complex analysis by means of his balance and finely-graduated weights. It is not that the action of the scales in the
      one case, and the balance in the other, differ in the principles of their construction or manner of working; but the beam of one is
      set on an infinitely finer axis than the other, and of course turns by the addition of a much smaller weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will understand this better, perhaps, if I give you some familiar example. You have all heard it repeated, I dare say, that men of
      science work by means of induction and deduction, and that by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of sense, wring from Nature
      certain other things, which are called natural laws, and causes, and that out of these, by some cunning skill of their own, they build
      up hypotheses and theories. And it is imagined by many, that the operations of the common mind can be by no means compared with these
      processes, and that they have to be acquired by a sort of special apprenticeship to the craft. To hear all these large words, you would
      think that the mind of a man of science must be constituted differently from that of his fellow men; but if you will not be frightened by
      terms, you will discover that you are quite wrong, and that all these terrible apparatus are being used by yourselves every day and every
      hour of your lives.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

    In other words, the idea he's putting forward is that scientific thinking is just regular thinking, but more refined. There is no "magic" in
    the scientific method that is reserved only for scientists doing real science. It's just a way of learning that is very similar to how
    people all over the world learn things. We pay attention to what's going on around us, we have ideas for what's happening, and then we see
    how those ideas play out in reality, and we allow that reality to refine our thinking a little bit more.
