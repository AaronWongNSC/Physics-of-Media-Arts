  <title>How Fast is That?</title>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>
      It used to be difficult to take videos, but pretty much everyone has a video camera on their cellphone. Furthermore, most cellphones are even capable of
      slow motion videos (as fast as 240 frames per second), which is far more technology than what was available just a decade ago. We are going to take advantage
      of this to use cellphones to record video in order to calculate speeds. We can also use the stopwatch feature to capture even more data.

    <title>Procedure</title>

    <p>
      The general task is to determine the speed of various objects by either using slow motion video or a stopwatch. The different tasks will be grouped
      by how they will be measured.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mark out a 25-meter straight-line course and time the following behaviors with a stopwatch. Each person in the lab group should participate
          (if possible), and each measurement should be taken three times.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The time it takes for a person to cover the distance while walking at a "normal" pace (whatever feels natural to them).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The time it takes for a person to cover the distance starting from standing still and running as fast as they are comfortable. (Please take care not
              to injure yourself!)
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Set up the measuring board in a safe area. Use the slow-motion video option on the cellphone to capture the object in motion. Your field of view for the
          camera should around twice as wide as the board. If you are too close, there will be too much distortion of distances due to the gap between the object
          and the board. If you are too far, you won't be able to see when the object clears the markings very well.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Throw a ball as fast as you can. It may take several attempts to capture usable footage. The ball should go past at about the same height as the
              measuring board. The goal is to get three successful attempts. (Try not to damage the phone or the person holding the phone!)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Run past the measuring board at your fastest comfortable speed. (In theory, this should be the same as the 25-meter run.) The measuring
              board should be about waist level, and you should try to focus on the same part of the body for each measurement.
            </p>
          </li>

    <title>Discussion</title>
      
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Explain how you can convert the table of times for the 25-meter walk or run into speed in meters per second. Then convert the values to speed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The average walking speed for an adult is typically between 1.2 and 1.4 m/s, but there are lots of variables that contribute to this, such as
          age, height, and individual characteristics. Did anyone in the group walk faster or slower than typical? Was that person aware of this before
          this lab?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Determine the framerate for the camera that was used for the slow motion footage. How much time does one frame represent?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Convert the average frame count for ball throw into seconds, and then convert those values to speed in meters per second. Organize
          these values into a table. Which student has the fastest and slowest average speeds? Is there any relevant information that might explain
          why these individuals' are what they are?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Convert the average frame count for the run into seconds, and then convert those values to speed in meters per second. Organize
          these values into a table. Compare these results with the times attained from the 25-meter run. Explain why it should make sense that the
          25-meter speed is slower than the 25-cm speed.

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    
    <p>
      We have explored two methods of measuring speed in this lab. Both methods come down to directly measuring the amount of time required for an
      object to travel a specific distance, which is the basic definition of the concept of speed. And while speeds were the ultimate result of our
      calculations, the activity of the lab was more about making measurements. We measured out markers to indicate distances and we used different
      both a stopwatch and digital video to measure time.
