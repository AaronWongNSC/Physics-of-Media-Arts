    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>
      We are going to use an online multiple tone generator app to experience different acoustic phenomena. Please make sure your headphones or speaker are turned
      down so that you don't accidentally damage your ears. Use the link at the bottom of the page.

    <title>Procedure</title>

    <p>
      We are going to do a number of explorations of sound using the multiple tone generator.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          We are first going to explore the concept of beats.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Set the tone generator to create two tones. Set both tones to be the Sine waveform and set both to be 440 Hz. Turn them both on. You should hear just one note.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now adjust one of the frequencies to be 441. You should continue to hear one tone, but it will sound different. Describe what you hear.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now adjust the frequency to 442. Describe what you hear, paying attention how the phenomenon changes. Continue doing this until you reach 445.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Repeat the same process, but now set both waveforms to square. Then do it again for sawtooth and triangle waves. Record your observations.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We are now going to look at tones in mathematical ratios. Throughout this exercise, keep the frequencies between 40 and 4000 Hz. You can use whatever waveform
          you want, as long as you keep them the same.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Pick three pairs of numbers that are in a 2:1 ratio to each other and play those sounds together. (For example, 800 and 400 are in a 2:1 ratio.) Describe
              what you hear.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Do this again with the following ratios: 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 5:4, and 5:2. Then pick two more ratios on your own. Describe what you hear, paying attention to
              whether you think (subjectively) they sound good or bad.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

          How would you describe the phenomenon that you heard when you were doing the sine waveform in the beats section? How did that phenomenon change as the two
          frequencies got further apart?

        <p>
          What did you hear when you were working with the ratios of frequencies? Were there any ratios that were more or less pleasant to listen to than others?
