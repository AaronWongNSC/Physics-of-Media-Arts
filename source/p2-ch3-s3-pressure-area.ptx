      The total force of pressure is often underestimated because the area over which it is applied is often overlooked.

    <title>Force from Pressure</title>

    <p>
      The basic relationship for pressure is <m>P = \frac{F}{A}</m>, which can be written as <m>F = PA</m>. This means that the total force from pressure depends on both
      the pressure and the area over which it is applied. This can sometimes be unanticipatedly large quantity.

      A common demonstration is breaking a piece of wood (like a ruler) using air pressure. <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvMmfacVA24">Video</url>. The
      air pressure is approximately 100 kPa (which is 14.7 psi). With only a 30 cm square (about 1 foot) sheet of paper, you get a total force of
      <m>F = (100,000 \text{ Pa}) \cdot (0.3 \text{ m}^2) = 9,000 \text{ N}</m> (just over 2000 pounds). In the demo, you're not getting the full force of air pressure
      because the paper doesn't form a vacuum seal with the table, but you can see that the theoretical maximum is much larger than what is needed to break the stick.
