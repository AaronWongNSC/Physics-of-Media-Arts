    <title>Procedure</title>

    <p>
        We are going to explore a number of different aspects of gears through experimentation and observation.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Take the two 12-tooth gears and mesh them on the the base plate so that they rotate together. Rotate one of the 12-tooth gears one full rotation and determine
          how much the other gear rotates. This value is known as the gear ratio. (Note: There is a line on the gears that you can use to help keep track of the position.)
          Repeat this with every combination of round gears. An example chart has been provided for you below.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We will now make a sequence of three gears. Mesh the followings gears in the indicated order: 12-24-30. They do not all need to be in a straight line. They just
          need to bein the correct order. Record how far the 24-tooth and 30-tooth gears rotate and in which direction when the 12-tooth gear does one complete rotation
          in the clockwise direction. Then pick 4 more sequences of three gears and do the same exercise. Record the results.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We will next work with the linear gear. You will need to use the linear gear backing plate to hold the linear gear up against the round gear. Note that the two
          sides of the backing piece are different sizes, so you might need to turn it around to get the appropriate distance. Create the following sequence of gears:
          Linear-12-24-Linear. As you push the first linear gear (attached to the 12-tooth gear), the other linear gear should move. Determine how much faster or slower
          the second linear gear moves relative to the first one (twice as fast, half as fast, same speed, etc.). Pick 4 more pairs of round gears in the middle and repeat
          the experiment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The peg of a round gears can be placed in the hole of another round gear to create a compound gear. We will always put the smaller gear on the bottom. (Otherwise,
          the gear mechanism won't function properly.) If you put the 24-tooth gear on top of the 12-tooth gear, we will denote that as [12,24]. Create the following sequence
          of gears: Linear-12-[12,24]-Linear. Note that the 12-tooth gear should be meshed with the 12-tooth gear of the [12,24] gear, and that the second linear gear should
          be meshed with the 24-tooth gear. Determine how much faster or slower the second linear gear moves relative to the first one (twice as fast, half as fast, same
          speed, etc.). Pick 4 more combinations of a round gears with a compound gear in the middle and repeat the experiment. (Note: Due to the physical sizes of the gears,
          some combinations may not function. If that happens, just pick another one and try again.)

    <title>Discussion</title>
      
    <p>
      We will now analyze the data we gathered to attempt to understand some of the basic properties of gears.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Based on the gear ratio data you collected, complete the following sentence: When the first gear rotates one time, the second gear will rotate ____ times.
          The value of the blank should be a formula that involves the number of teeth of the first gear and the number of teeth of the second gear.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Based on the three gear sequence data you collected, describe the pattern of directions that the gears have with each other. If a fourth gear were added,
          which direction would it turn if the first gear is rotated in the clockwise direction?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Based on the three gear sequence data you collected, describe the impact of the middle gear on the rotation speed of the last gear.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Based on the linear gear data you collected, what can you conclude about the relative speed of the linear gears when using just basic (non-compound) gears?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Based on the compound gear data you collected, write a sentence that describes how you can determine the speed of the second linear gear based on the gears that
          are in between them.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
