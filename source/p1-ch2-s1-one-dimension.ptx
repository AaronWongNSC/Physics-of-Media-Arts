      In this section, we will be focusing on describing the kinematics objects when there is a constant acceleration. Before getting started, we are going to
      introduce some basic notation.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>a</m>: The constant acceleration.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>v = v(t)</m>: Velocity as a function of time. This notation means that we will sometimes use a <m>v</m> by itself, but you need to remember that this
          changes with time. If we need to explicitly indicate the time, we will use the second notation with <m>t</m> being the specific value.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>v_0 = v(0)</m>: Initial velocity. Notice that this notation means that we are using the velocity at time <m>t = 0</m> as the value of <m>v_0</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>s = s(t)</m>: Position as a function of time. This follows the same notation rules as velocity.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>s_0 = s(0)</m>: Initial position.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
