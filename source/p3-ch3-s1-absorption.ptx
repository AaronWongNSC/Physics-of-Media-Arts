      Absorption of light is when the photon's energy is absorbed into the surface that it hits. We know that when we see a black surface, we are seeing the absence of
      colors and that when we see a white surface, we're seeing "all" of the colors. When the photon hits the black surface, the energy of the photon is literally being
      taken in by the surface, and this causes the surface to get warmer. This explains why black surfaces are hotter than white surfaces when left in the sun. The black
      surface is absorbing many more photons than the white surface, and that energy is being converted into heat.

      Absorption can be a little bit counter-intuitive. When we see a colored surface, we tend to think of the color as a property of the surface. For example, we see
      green grass and think that the grass itself is a green thing. That can lead us to think that the grass is absorbing green light (because it is absorbing the "stuff"
      that makes it green.) However, it works in the opposite way. We see grass as green because it reflects green light to our eyes. It's actually absorbing all of the
      other colors of light.

      Sometimes, people erroneously think that this means that plants grown under green light will simply die (because it can't "take in" light for photosynthesis), but
      that's an oversimplification of the biology. Even though a lot of green light is reflected, some of it is still absorbed and can be used by the plant for making energy.
