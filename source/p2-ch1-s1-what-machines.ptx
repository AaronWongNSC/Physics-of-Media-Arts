      In this section, we are going to explore the classical simple machines. For our purposes here we will say that a <term>simple machine</term> is a mechanical device that
      changes the direction or magnitude of a force. There are six machines that are considered to be the classical simple machines: the lever, the wheel and axle, the pulley,
      the inclined plane, the wedge, and the screw. Each will have its own section.

    <title>Mechanical Advantage</title>

      <idx><h>mechanical advantage</h></idx>

      The mechanical advantage of a machine is how much the machine multiplies the input force. For example, if a force of 10 N into a machine results in an output
      force of 20 N, the mechanical advantage of 2:1. It is possible for machines to have very large mechanical advantages. For example, a car jack takes forces
      generate by human arms to lift a vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds.

      The tradeoff of mechanical advantage is usually a tradoff between force and distance. For example, if you are using a pulley system that gives you a 10:1 mechanical
      advantage, it might be that you are getting 10 times the force in the output, but it's only going to move 1/10 of the distance.

    <title>Not Technically A Simple Machine</title>

    <p>
      Sometimes, people like to include gears as a simple machine. This is typically frowned upon because a gear on its own is not able to accomplish the multiplication
      of force that defines the simple machines. It requires a system of gears to do that. But a system of gears can be broken down into multiple wheel and axles with levers
      or pulleys, depending on whether the gears are meshed together directly or linked together by chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in my mind, this isn't a fight worth having. The reason I want to stick to the classical simple machines is that the topic of gears is quite expansive, and there
      are a lot of different ideas that can be explored. And that's just too much for the time and space that we have for this topic.
