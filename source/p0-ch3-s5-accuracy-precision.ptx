      Physics is built upon measurements, and the quality of the work is often related to the quality of the measurements. However, there are multiple ways to interpret
      the question of quality. The two primary concepts to keep in mind are accuracy and precision.

      Accuracy refers to how close the measurement is to the "true" value.

      Incidentally, it's not always clear that there is a "true" value when it comes to measurements. For example, your height is different at different times of the day,
      so you have no "true" height. Similarly, the weight of objects may change slightly over time. When you smell a steak, you are smelling molecules that are leaving
      that steak, and those lost molecules remove some of the weight from the steak (albeit a very small amount).
