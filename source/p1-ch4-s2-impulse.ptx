      In the previous section, we derived the equation <m>F \Delta t = \Delta p</m> from Newton's Second Law of Motion when framed in terms of momentum. In this section,
      we are going to explore what this means.

          <term>Impulse</term> is the change of momentum of an obejct when it is acted on by a force. Specifically, it is calculated as <m>\Delta p = F \Delta t</m>,
          where the force <m>F</m> is fixed and applied over a period of time <m>\Delta t</m>.

      There are a couple aspects about this that are conceptually easy to understand. The first is that larger forces should lead to larger changes of momentum. The second
      is that a force applied over a longer period of time should lead to a larger change of momentum than the same amount of force being applied for a short period of time.
      And both of these intuitions are captured in the formula for impulse.
