  <title>Two-Dimensional Position Graphs</title>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>
      We saw how one-dimensional motion can be presented as a position graph with time as the horizontal axis and position as the vertical axis. But how do
      these ideas extend into more dimensions? It turns out that each dimension can have its own motion graphs, and that by properly aligning the motion in
      both dimensions, it's possible to create the desired movements. We will be using simple flip books as the medium to help us gain a deeper understanding of
      this process.

    <title>Procedure</title>

    <p>
        The task will be broken into two phases. The first phase is to prepare the flipbook materials. The second phase is to create animations based on
        the given position graphs.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Since the animations we are drawing are going to be given by graphs, it will be important that each page of the flipbook is drawn consistently, otherwise
          the motion will not appear the way it should. In order to be consistent, it is helpful to create a template that you will use to create all of the pages
          of animations with.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Take an index card and lay it out so that the long direction is horizontal. Measure 3 cm in from the left side and draw a vertical line. This is just
              a margin for the binder clip, so it doesn't need to be perfect.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Measure 5 cm from the left edge and draw another vertical line. Try to get this line as close to vertical as possible. This will be the left edge
              of your frame. Do the same thing at 11 cm. This will be the right edge of your frame. (You may find it helpful to measure the distances at the top
              and bottom of the index card, and then use those two markings to get a good vertical line.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Draw a horizontal line down the middle of the card. It doesn't need to be exactly in the middle, but you should try to make it as close to horizontal
              as possible. Measure 3 cm above and below this line at the left and right edges of the frame and connect those points to create a 6 cm by 6 cm square.
              This square is the entirety of your frame.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Carefully cut out the square. Make 1 cm markings all the way around the square. These will be your reference markings to help you determine the
              coordinates of the points in your frame. Label the markings from -3 to 3 left-to-right, and again bottom-to-top. In the end, you should have something
              that looks like this:
            </p>

              <image source="images/2d-position-graphs/template.png" />

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Below are several pairs of graphs that represent the x and y positions of an object that you are going to animate. For each pair, you will be given
          a total number of frames of animation that you will need to make with it. You will need to draw the correct number of vertical lines to ensure that
          you traverse the animation with roughly equal time steps. An example is provided below. You can choose the shape of your object, but it is recommended
          to keep it simple (like a circle or a square). You will want to try to draw the object the same size every frame.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              ANIMATION 1
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              ANIMATION 2
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              ANIMATION 3
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <example>
    <title>Sample Animation</title>
    
    <p>
      Consider the following graphs:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <image source="images/2d-position-graphs/sample1.png" width="50%"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The first step is to break the animation into 9 equally-spaced frames. We will denote these frames with vertical lines. Notice that in order to get 9 frames,
      you must have 8 spaces. Corresponding to each frame is an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. We have listed these under each marking.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <image source="images/2d-position-graphs/sample2.png" width="50%"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      These coordinates give us the locations to draw our shape (a circle for this example), with each shape getting its own frame. All of the images are drawn together
      here just to save space. Also notice that frames 1 and 9 are in the same position. From this, we can see that this is the animation of an object moving around a
      rotated square.

          What experiences have you had (before this lab) with making flipbooks animations? If you've made flipbooks, what are the similarities and differences
          between what you've done in the past and this lab?

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    
    <p>
      For this lab, we focused on just the position of the object being animated. But this same concept can be applied to a much wider range of behaviors.
      For example, it's possible that one of the graphs will represent the rotation of the object or the angle of a joint. By stacking multiple layers of these
      graphs on top of an object, it's possible to create extremely nuanced behaviors.
