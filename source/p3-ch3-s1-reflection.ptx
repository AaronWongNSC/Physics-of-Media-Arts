      For this section, we're going to be thinking about light as if it were a particle. While there are some effects that we might consider when considering the wave
      nature of light (interference patterns, for example), we're going to set those aside.

      Look around the room and think about all of the different types of surfaces that you might see. Perhaps there's a window and you see some glare that partially obscures
      the outside world. Perhaps there's a mirror and you can see a perfect image as if you're looking through a window into a different universe. Perhaps there are walls of
      different colors that you see, or textures on the floor that you see. Maybe there's a glass of water and you can see a strange bending effect.

      All of these types of interactions can be understood using three light concepts: absorption, reflection, refraction. Sometimes, a photon hits a surface, and then it
      ceases to exist. This is known as absorption. When this happens, the photon basically gives its energy to the surface. Other times, the photon bounces off of the surface.
      This is known as reflection. And sometimes, the photon passes through a surface, but perhaps with some changes to its direction. This is known as refraction.

      We'll start with the concept of absorption.
