      Momentum is a property of objects in motion. In a sense, it measures "how much" movement there is. One way that people think about momentum is
      to ask the following question: "How much will this hurt if it hits me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easiest to understand by thinking about comparisons between similar situations. Suppose you have two identical objects, where one is moving
      slowly and the other is moving quickly. The fast-moving object has "more" movement than the slow-moving object, and so that one has more momentum.
      But now consider a tiny object and a massive object that are moving at the same speed. Even though the speeds are the same, there's still "more"
      movement in the large object than the smaller one. And so we can see that the idea of momentum involves both the mass and the velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two types of momentum: linear momentum and angular momentum. We will introduce both, but our focusing will be on linear momentum. Unless
      otherwise noted, when you see momentum in this book, it will be referring linear momentum.

    <title>Linear Momentum</title>

    <definition xml:id="def-linear-momentum">
      <idx><h>linear momentum</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>linear momentum</term> of an object the product of the mass of the object and its velocity vector.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Notice from the definition that increasing either mass or velocity will increase the momentum of an object. This matches with the discussion
      at the start of the section. Since momentum is the product of a scalar and a vector, it is a vector quantity. This isn't as important to think
      about when  we are working in just one direction, but it becomes essential to understand when we are working in higher dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SI units of momentum are <m>\frac{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}}{\text{s}}</m>. By itself, this doesn't say very much. But if we compare it to the
      units of force, we can see that the two are very similar. The SI units of force are <m>\frac{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}}{\text{s}^2}</m>. The only
      difference between the two is that force has an extra dimension of seconds in the denominator. In other words, force has units of momentum over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the connection runs much deeper. Newton's Second Law of Motion can actually be phrased in terms of momentum:
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-Newton-Second-Law-Momentum">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The net force on an object at any instant of time is equal to the rate of change of its momentum. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In other words, forces lead to changes in momentum. This idea is written mathematically in the following manner: <m> F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}</m>.
      The <m>\Delta</m> notation can be read as "the change of" and is a common notation in both math and physics. (You might remember seeing the formula for
      the slope of a line as <m>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m>. It's the exact same thing.) By multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>\Delta t</m>,
      we have another version of the equation: <m>F \Delta t = \Delta p</m>. This is the formula for impulse, which we will discuss in the next section.

    <title>Angular Momentum</title>

    <p>
      Angular momentum is the momentum of spinning objects. It's quite a bit more complicated than linear momentum, and it's even less intuitive when you
      get into the details. If you have a record spinning on a standard record player, the angular momentum is pointing up because it is spinning counter-clockwise.
      The exact reason it's pointing up and the consequences of that are difficult to understand intuitively. In some sense, the reason is that this is what
      works out mathematically. But that's unsatisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of trying to get the full flavor of angular momentum and its consequences, we are going to think about some of the basic ideas and try to build
      some core intuitions about it. The underlying question is about how difficult it is to get something to rotate (or to stop rotating). We will use a thought
      experiment. Suppose you are holding a stick with a weighted ball at the end of it. Will it be easier or harder to swing twist the stick so that the ball
      swings around if the stick is short or long?
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people intuitively understand that the long stick would be more difficult, and that is the correct answer. So this tells us that angular momentum depends
      on how far away from the axis of rotation. It also depends on the mass, just as with linear angular momentum.
