      We have seen a few types of forces in our discussion of Newton's Laws of Motion. In this section, we're going to explore some of these forces
      in a bit more detail to expand our understanding of forces.

    <title>Friction</title>

    <p>
      <idx><h>friction</h></idx>

      Friction is the force that resists the relative movement of objects sliding against each other. Friction can occur between many types of objects: solid objects
      against other solid objects, solid objects against a fluid (such as air or water resistance), and a fluid against itself are just some of the ways friction can
      be manifested.

      <idx><h>kinetic friction</h></idx>
      <idx><h>static friction</h></idx>

      We are going to focus our attention on the friction between solid objects. But even this isn't quite an entirely simple concept, because there are two types of
      friction. There's <term>static friction</term>, which is the friction between two objects when there is no movement between them, and then there's
      <term>kinetic friction</term>, which is the friction between two objects when they are moving relative to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <idx><h>coefficient of static friction</h></idx>
      
      The formula for the force of friction between two objects at rest relative to each other is <m>F \leq \mu_s N</m>, where <m>N</m> is the magnitude of the normal force
      and <m>\mu_s</m> is the <term>coefficient of static friction</term>, whose value depends on the two surfaces that are in contact with each other. The direction of the
      friction force is always opposite of the direction that resists movement. Smaller values of <m>\mu_s</m> mean that there is less friction, with 0 being no friction at
      all. The reason that the force is given as an inequality is that the quantity on the right represents the maximum amount of friction that can exist between the two
      surfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <idx><h>coefficient of kinetic friction</h></idx>

      The <term>coefficient of kinetic friction</term> (denoted <m>\mu_k</m>) plays the same role as the coefficient of static friction, except it applies when the two objects are sliding
      past each other. The coefficient of kinetic friction is always smaller than the coefficient of static friction for the same pair of objects. You have experienced
      this if you have ever tried to move something heavy. It takes a certain amount of effort to get it moving, and once it's moving it takes less effort to keep it
      moving. In this case, the formula is <m>F = \mu_k N</m>, and this is an equality because in this situation the friction is always at its maximal value. If the
      movement of the object slows down to the point that it is no longer moving, then we would be back in the case of static friction.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Inclined Plane with Friction</title>
      
      <p>
        We are going to consider an object at rest on an inclined plane at the angle <m>\theta</m>. We want to understand how friction fits into this picture as we
        slowly increase the slope to point that the object begins sliding.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we look at the free body diagram for this situation, we will see that there are three forces. Gravity is pulling the object downward into the inclined
        plane, the inclined plane exerts a normal force, and the static friction points parallel to the incline in the upward direction (opposite the direction
        the block would slide without friction). ......
