      We will now start to put Newton's Laws of Motion into practice. We will consider the motion of objects under the influence of various forces, and think
      about their corresponding free body diagrams. By understanding these diagrams, we will have a deeper understanding of one of the core tools used to
      analyze physical situations.

    <title>Gravity</title>

    <p>
      We have already discussed the acceleration of an object caused by gravitational attraction. From Newton's Second Law of Motion, we know that
      the force is the product of the object's mass and its acceleration, so that the force of gravity can be written as <m>F_{\text{g}} = mg</m>, where
      <m>g</m> is the acceleration from gravity for the problem (earth gravity is <m>g = 9.8 \text{m}/\text{s}^2</m>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The free body diagram for this on its own is just a single arrow pointing doward, indicating the force of gravity on the object. As it stands, this object
      is experiencing a net force, and so it is accelerating downward. If there's nothing to apply an upward force, the object will continue to accelerate,
      causing it to fall faster and faster.

    <title>Air Resistance</title>

    <p>
      We are going to add some air resistance to the gravity example. Now as the object is falling, it's also experiencing air resistance. This can be thought of as the
      impact of the object bumping into molecules of as it falls. As it falls faster, it bumps into more air, and so it experiences more resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The free body diagram now has two forces. Gravity is still pulling it downward, but now there's also an upward force that we can call <m>F_{\text{air}}</m>. The
      size of this force will depend on a number of factors, such as the weight and shape of the object. An object that is more streamline in the direction of motion
      will hit fewer air molecules than something that is bulky in that direction. But regardless of the shape, there is some amount of upward force from the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      <idx><h>terminal velocity</h></idx>

      There is a specific when the force of gravity perfectly matches the force of air resistance. This is known as <term>terminal velocity</term>. When an object is
      falling at terminal velocity, there is zero net force on the object because the two forces are perfectly cancelling each other out. This means that there is no
      acceleration, which means that the object's motion is unchanging (Newton's First Law), and the object will remain at this velocity until something changes.
    </p>

    <title>Normal Forces</title>

    <p>
      One of the most challenging types of forces to understand is the <term>normal force</term>. This is the force that an object imparts on another object when they
      interact with each other. This force is always viewed as being perpendicular to the surface.("Normal" is a mathematical term for perpendicularity.) Such forces
      always exist whenever two objects are physically interacting with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider a ball sitting on a table. If we tried to apply Newton's First Law, we would see an object at rest that is staying at rest, and so we know that
      there is no net force acting on it. However, since this ball is subject to gravity, and gravity is a downward force, in our force diagram we must have a downward
      arrow to represent that. If this were the only force acting on the ball, then the ball would start to accelerate towards the ground. But the ball is at rest, and
      that's because the table is applying an upward force to the ball. And since the ball is at rest, the upward force of the table must be exactly equal to the
      downard force of gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also see how this normal force works to create motion. Instead of thinking of the ball on a table, let's think about it on an incline. Remember that
      the normal force is always perpendicular to the surface, so that the incline does not apply a vertical force to the ball. When we draw the force diagram,
      we will have gravity pulling the ball downward, but then the normal force would push up at an angle. Notice that the angle of the normal force indicates which
      direction (left or right) the ball is going to roll. In fact, we can know that the net force the ball is going to experience must be parallel to the incline
      because that's the ultimate direction the ball will move. From this, we can do a vector analysis to determine exactly how large the normal force must be.

    <title>Surface Friction</title>

    <p>
      <idx><h>friction</h></idx>

      Friction is the force that resists the relative movement of objects sliding against each other. Friction can occur between many types of objects: solid objects
      against other solid objects, solid objects against a fluid (such as air or water resistance), and a fluid against itself are just some of the ways friction can
      be manifested.
    </p>
    <p>
      <idx><h>kinetic friction</h></idx>
      <idx><h>static friction</h></idx>

      We are going to focus our attention on the friction between solid objects, which is known as <term>surface friction</term>. But even this isn't quite an entirely
      simple concept, because there are two types of friction. There's <term>static friction</term>, which is the friction between two objects when there is no movement
      between them, and then there's <term>kinetic friction</term>, which is the friction between two objects when they are moving relative to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <idx><h>coefficient of static friction</h></idx>
      
      The formula for the force of friction between two objects at rest relative to each other is <m>F \leq \mu_s N</m>, where <m>N</m> is the magnitude of the normal force
      and <m>\mu_s</m> is the <term>coefficient of static friction</term>, whose value depends on the two surfaces that are in contact with each other. The direction of the
      friction force is always opposite of the direction that resists movement. Smaller values of <m>\mu_s</m> mean that there is less friction, with 0 being no friction at
      all. The reason that the force is given as an inequality is that the quantity on the right represents the maximum amount of friction that can exist between the two
      surfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <idx><h>coefficient of kinetic friction</h></idx>

      The <term>coefficient of kinetic friction</term> (denoted <m>\mu_k</m>) plays the same role as the coefficient of static friction, except it applies when the two
      objects are sliding past each other. The coefficient of kinetic friction is always smaller than the coefficient of static friction for the same pair of objects.
      You have experienced this if you have ever tried to move something heavy. It takes a certain amount of effort to get it moving, and once it's moving it takes less
      effort to keep it moving. In this case, the formula is <m>F = \mu_k N</m>, and this is an equality because in this situation the friction is always at its maximal
      value. If the movement of the object slows down to the point that it is no longer moving, then we would be back in the case of static friction.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Inclined Plane with Friction</title>
      
      <p>
        We are going to consider an object at rest on an inclined plane at the angle <m>\theta</m>. We want to understand how friction fits into this picture as we
        slowly increase the slope, but not so steep that the object begins sliding.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we look at the free body diagram for this situation, we will see that there are three forces. Gravity (<m>F_\text{g}</m>) is pulling the object downward into the
        inclined plane, the inclined plane exerts a normal force (<m>F_\text{N}</m>), and the static friction (<m>F_{\text{fr}}</m>) points parallel to the incline in the
        upward direction (opposite the direction the block would slide without friction). Our task is to determine the magnitudes of all of these forces. Since nothing is
        changing its movement, the net force is zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know the formula for the gravitational force (<m>F_\text{g} = mg</m>) and the force of friction (<m>F_\text{fr} = \mu_s F_\text{N}</m>, but we don't know the
        the normal force. All we know is that this force must balance out gravity and friction in order to keep the object stationary. We will decompose all of
        the vectors into a part that is parallel to the surface and a part that is perpendicular to the surface. (We could have done vertical and horizontal components,
        but the equations end up being a little bit messier.) Using trigonometry, we can get the following equations:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>mg \cos \theta \amp = F_\text{N}</mrow>
        <mrow>mg \sin \theta \amp = \mu_s \cdot F_\text{N}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        The first equation gives us the normal force, and we can plug this into the second equation to solve for the coefficient of friction.
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow> mg \sin \theta \amp = \mu_s \cdot F_\text{N}  </mrow>
        <mrow> mg \sin \theta \amp = \mu_s \cdot mg \cos(\theta)  </mrow>
        <mrow> \mu_s \amp = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \tan(\theta) </mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        What this is telling us is that the coefficient of friction is equal to the tangent of the angle of the incline, at least as long as nothing is moving. But if
        the angle is steep enough, the value of <m>\tan(\theta)</m> will exceed the maximum value of <m>\mu_s</m> and the forces will no longer be in balance.
        In particular, the friction force will change from static friction to a kinetic friction (causing it to get smaller), and the forces in the direction parallel to
        the plane will no longer be in balance. There will be more force pointing down the slope than pointing up, which means that the object will begin sliding downward.
