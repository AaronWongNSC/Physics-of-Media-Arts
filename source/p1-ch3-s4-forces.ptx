      We have seen a few types of forces in our discussion of Newton's Laws of Motion. In this section, we're going to explore some of these forces
      in a bit more detail to expand our understanding of forces.

      Friction is the force that resists the relative movement of objects sliding against each other. Friction can occur between many types of objects: solid objects
      against other solid objects, solid objects against a fluid (such as air or water resistance), and a fluid against itself are just some of the ways friction can
      be manifested.

      <idx><h>static friction</h></idx>

      We are going to focus our attention on the friction between solid objects. But even this isn't quite an entirely simple concept, because there are two types of
      friction. There's <term>static friction</term>, which is the friction between two objects when there is no movement between them, and then there's
      <term>kinetic friction</term>, which is the friction between two objects when they are moving relative to each other. Fortunately, both types of friction are
      calculated using the same method.
    </p>
    <p>
      <idx><h>coefficient of friction</h></idx>
      
      The formula for the force of friction between two objects is <m>F = \mu N</m>, where <m>N</m> is the magnitude of the normal force and <m>\mu</m> is the
      <term>coefficient of friction</term>, whose value depends on the two surfaces that are in contact with each other. The direction of the friction force is
      always opposite of the direction that resists movement. Smaller values of <m>\mu</m> mean that there is less friction, with 0 being no friction at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coefficient of kinetic friction is always smaller than the coefficient of static friction for the same pair of objects.
