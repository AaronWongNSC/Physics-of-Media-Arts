    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>
      A common conspiracy theory is that we didn't land on the moon, and that all of the footage was done in a studio. We are going to look at one
      theorized aspect of the footage, which is that the moon gravity was faked by filming at a high frame rate and slowing it down to give the
      appearance of a low gravity environment. We are going to perform a practical test of this theory to see whether the time-slowing physics
      matches with the theory of low gravity physics.
