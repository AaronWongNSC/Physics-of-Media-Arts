    <p>
      For the first activity, stand with your heels against the wall and stand upright (with your back against the wall). Start bending over at the waist. As you
      lean over, you will feel your muscles tense up differently as the center of mass starts to move from the center of your feet towards your toes. As soon as
      the center of mass moves beyond your toes, your body will start to tip over and there's nothing you can do other than move your feet to keep yourself from
      falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second activity, put the outside of one of your feet up against the wall, and then lean into the wall with the shoulder on the same side of the body.
      You should find that it's impossible for you to stay upright when you lift your outside foot. The reason behind this is that your base is only as wide as your
      foot, but your body is much wider than that, and so even with your shoulder pressed against the wall, your center of mass is not over your base, and you are
      going to fall over.
