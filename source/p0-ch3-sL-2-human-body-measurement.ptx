          Liberals get angry and tell us that the metric system is more "rational" than the measurements everyone understands. This is ridiculous. An inch is
          the width of a man's thumb, a foot the length of his foot, a yard the length of his belt. That's easy to visualize. How do you visualize 147.2 centimeters?

    <p>
      Ignoring the politics beind an op-ed that was written by a political firebrand in 2014, there's an interesting point about understanding measurements. All measurements
      are grounded in a history of trying to relate quantities to each other. In particular, lengths are historically related to lengths of things that people encounter all
      of the time, such as the length of an adult male foot or the size of a thumb. That said, these heuristic measurements are inaccurate because different people have
      different bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lab is about coming to understand your own body and learning how to estimate measurements with it. More specifically, you are going to develop metric intuition
      with your body. Familiarity with units comes with experience, and we're going to develop a set of experiences to help you become familiar with these values.

    <title>Procedure</title>

    <p>
        Every member of the group will perform a series of measurements to understand the dimensions of their body, and then practice making measurements
        with them.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using the ruler, perform the following measurements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Thumb width: Press your thumb onto the ruler to determine its width in cm. Note that different thumbs have different amounts of "squishiness" and so
              consistency of how you press your thumb matters. It works best to press you thumb in a way that "feels natural" to you. Don't try to "remember" how hard
              you have to press in order to achieve a certain dimension, because that's something you're unlikely to remember.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Hand span: Open your hand with your thumb and pinky finger spread out, and measure the distance from the tip of one to the tip of the other in cm. Just as with
              the thumb width, you want to do it in a way that is consistent, and whatever "feels natural" when you're doing this is probably the best option. You should not
              be trying to get the maximum possible distance. 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using the meter stick, perform the following measurements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Cubit: A cubit is the distance from the tip of the elbow to the tip of the middle finger when the fingers are held straight out. Measure this directly
              on the meter stick. Give the result in cm.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Shoe length: Directly measure the length of your shoe. Give the result in cm.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Heel-to-toe step length: Using the meter stick, mark off a distance of 50 cm and 100 cm on the ground from a fixed starting point. Count the number of
              heel-to-toe steps that are needed to get to either the 50 cm mark or 100 cm mark. The mark you pick should be the one that ends the closest to an exact
              number of for your shoe size. It's likely that you will be "just a little" long or short. Try to estimate this to the quarter-shoe length. Give the result
              in cm.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using the 30 meter tape measure, perform the following measurements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Arm span: The arm span is the distance from finger tip to finger tip when both arms are held out to the side. This should be measurable directly, but it
              might be difficult to do by yourself. Give the result in meters.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Single step length: We will call a "single step" a step where you start with your feet side-by-side and take a single step forward, and then bringing your
              feet back to the side-by-side position. Using tape or other markings on the ground, create a starting line and line your toes up with it. Then take a single
              step and mark the final position of your feet. Then use those to measure your "single step" length. Give the result in meters
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Pacing step length: A "pacing step" is a step that you make while walking normally. This is difficult to measure directly since you would need to focus
              on your feet a lot to get a good measurable step (starting in the right place and ending in a way that is easily measurable). Instead, we will take an
              average pacing step by walking out a measured distance and counting the steps. Using the cones, mark off a starting position, then a 20-meter mark, a 25-meter
              mark, and a 30 meter mark. From the starting position, walk as naturally as you can while counting your steps. Pick the mark that most accurately captures
              an exact number of steps and use that information to calculate your "pacing step" length. Give the result in meters.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now that you have some measurements to work with, you will now practice using your body to measure various objects. Use multiple measurements
          where it's reasonable to do so. Be sure to indicate the measurement in terms of the method (arm span, etc.) and give the final estimate
          in either cm or m, depending on which is more appropriate.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Take a piece of regular office paper and try to cut a rectangle whose dimensions are 10 cm by 15 cm. Then measure the rectangles with a ruler, and
              write down the results.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

              Estimate the width and height of a doorway. (You may require a step stool or chair to reach the top of the doorway.) Write down the estimates,
              then measure it directly.
            </p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    
    <p>
      The use of the human body to make measurements is deeply grounded in history, and the results are grounded in experience. Although there is value
      to having standardized measurements and tools to make those measurements, it's not always the case that there is access to those tools. In those
      situations, it can be helpful to understand the size of your own body and use that to make estimates.
