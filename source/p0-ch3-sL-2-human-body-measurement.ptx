          Liberals get angry and tell us that the metric system is more "rational" than the measurements everyone understands. This is ridiculous. An inch is
          the width of a man's thumb, a foot the length of his foot, a yard the length of his belt. That's easy to visualize. How do you visualize 147.2 centimeters?

    <p>
      Ignoring the politics beind an op-ed that was written by a political firebrand in 2014, there's an interesting point about understanding measurements. All measurements
      are grounded in a history of trying to relate quantities to each other. In particular, lengths are historically related to lengths of things that people encounter all
      of the time, such as the length of an adult male foot or the size of a thumb. That said, these heuristic measurements are inaccurate because different people have
      different bodies.

      This lab is about coming to understand your own body and learning how to estimate measurements with it. More specifically, you are going to develop metric intuition
      with your body. Familiarity with units comes with experience, and we're going to develop a set of experiences to help you become familiar with these values.
