    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>
      A common conspiracy theory is that we didn't land on the moon, and that all of the footage was done in a studio. We are going to look at one
      theorized aspect of the footage, which is that the moon gravity was faked by filming at a high frame rate and slowing it down to give the
      appearance of a low gravity environment. We are going to perform a practical test of this theory to see whether the time-slowing physics
      matches with the theory of low gravity physics.

    <title>Procedure</title>

    <p>
        We are going to test the conspiracy theory by directly filming with a high framerate and then adjusting the timing to try to match the altered
        gravity. Then we will examine the details of the behavior to see whether the underlying physics remains consistent.

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Film a marble being dropped from a height of one meter and landing on the floor in slow motion. Do this in front of the meter stick so that you will
          be able to take measurements. It may be helpful to film this a few times to ensure that you have good video to work with.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Calculate the time it should take the marble to fall 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, ..., 100 cm under moon gravity. Organize this information into a chart.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using the time it should take an object to fall 100 cm (1 m), determine the appropriate framerate that the video should be running at in order to
          mimic moon gravity. (Note: You will need to know the total number of frames required for the object to fall.) Adjust the video framerate accordingly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using the adjusted video, determine the amount of time it took for the marble fall 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, ..., 100 cm. Organize this information into
          a chart.

          How well did the moon gravity video align with the theoretical values? Is this difference enough to be noticable in this situation?
