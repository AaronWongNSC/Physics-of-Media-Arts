    We can think of the SI units as the building blocks for more complicated concepts. For example, speed is the measure of how far an object travels in 
    a particular amount of time. This means that we can't have speed unless we have both distance and time. The purpose of the SI base units is that it
    gives us the foundation upon which we can build all of the other physics concepts. Everything from here forward will involve some combination of those
    units.

    Here are some examples of some physics concepts and their associated units:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Speed (<m>\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}</m>): A measure of how far an object travels in a particular amount of time.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Acceleration (<m>\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}</m>): A measure of the change of speed over a period of time.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Force (<m>\frac{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}}{\text{s}^2}</m>): A measure of the push or pull applied to an object.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Some of the units are given names to simplify the concepts. For example, the unit of force is a Newton, and it can be understood
    as the amount of force needed to accelerate a one kilogram mass at the the rate of one meter per second squared. There are also some
    concepts that have units that are easily calculated, but are extremely challenging to describe directly. For example, momentum is
    calculated as the product of mass and velocity, but what it measures might be described as the amount of stored motion within a mass.

    It would be good to review <xref="sec-basic-algebra"> for multiple unit conversions and unit conversions involving exponents.
