    <p>
      Much of physics is about understanding the relationship between different variables. One of the ways we can identify such relationships is by graphing.
      While graphs may not be as precise as formulas, it gives us a language that we can use to try to understand certain types of relationships intuitively.
      We will specifically be focusing on the relationship between two variables, though many of these ideas can be extended to more variables.
