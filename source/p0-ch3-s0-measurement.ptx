  <introduction>
    <p>
      Without measurements, it is hard to do physics. You can have some conceptual ideas for how different concepts relate to each other, but it will not be
      very clear how you would communicate them. For example, you can know that a "big" object weighs more than a "small" object, but if I give you an object,
      you won't be able to describe its weight without referencing some other objects. And those comparisons will likely be very loose. So it is important for
      us to spend a little time talking about measurements and getting some more experience with them.
