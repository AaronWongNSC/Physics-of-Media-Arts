  <introduction>
    <p>
      This is a conceptual physics course, so we will try to avoid as much of the algebra as possible to keep our focus on the big ideas
      and off of the computations that can sometimes obscure them. However, we cannot completely get rid of the mathematical toolbox because
      the connection between math and physics runs extremely deep. The sections of this chapter will develop the bare minimum set of mathematical
      skills and ideas that are needed to understand the ideas of this book.
