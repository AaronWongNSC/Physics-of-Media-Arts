      <idx><h>imperial system</h></idx>

      While most of the world and all of science operates using the metric system, daily life in the US usually revolves around the
      <term>imperial system</term> of measurement. This is the system of quarts, gallons, feet, and miles that you're probably most
      accustomed to seeing. In fact, there are only three countries in the world that officially operate on the imperial system!
      (The other two countries are Liberia and Myanmar.) 
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason the imperial system is called that is because it was originally the system of units imposed on countries by the British
      Empire during the time of colonialism (imperial means "of the empire"). Somewhat confusingly, the imperial system wasn't formalized
      until the 1820s. Before that, there was a vast array of customary measures used in various locations, some of which date back to the
      1500s (and potentially even earlier).
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual origins of individual measurements were often rather arbitrary. For example, the length we call a foot today was originally
      the length of King Henry I's foot. And an inch has been defined muliple ways, including the length of three grains of barley laid end-to-end
      and the length of twelve poppy seeds. There are also other historical measurements that are similarly arbitrary, such as a cubit (the length
      from your elbow to the tip of your outstretched middle finger) and a league (the distance a person can walk in an hour). Of course, differences
      in individual human bodies made these measurements to be rough estimates at best. And the convoluted history and origins of these measurements
      have led to the equally convoluted relationships between them, such as 5280 feet in a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this lab, we are going to explore some more of the history of different units and practice making unit conversions using the imperial system.

    <title>Procedure</title>

    <p>
        This lab consists of a lot of calculations. When doing your calculations, show the multiplication by the appropriate conversion factors and make sure that
        the units cancel appropriately.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          As noted above, an inch has been interpreted as being the length of three grains of barley laid end-to-end and as the length of twelve poppy seeds.
          From this information, estimate the average length of a grain of barley and the average length of a poppy seed. (Use a three digit decimal approximation.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Research the size of grains of barley and poppy seeds. How close are your calculations in the previous step to the values you found?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Sticking with the historical relationships, we can establish two length equalities: <m>1 \text{ inch} = 3 \text{ grains of barley}</m> and
          <m>1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ poppy seeds}</m>. Use these relationships to perform the following unit conversions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Convert 5 feet to poppy seeds.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Convert 12 yards to grains of barley.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Convert 2 miles to poppy seeds.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Convert 600 poppy seeds miles to grains of barley.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Another set of linear units were used for agricultural purposes. These are rods, chains, and furlongs. A chain is 4 rods, and a furlong is 10 chains.
          If you are familiar with horse racing, you probably know that there are 8 furlongs in a mile. From this information, determine the length of rods,
          chains, and furlongs in feet. Then perform the following unit conversions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Convert 200 yards to chains.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Convert 100 feet to rods.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Convert 1 furlong to poppy seeds.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Liquid measurements often developed from commercial operations involving alcohol. You might know that both wine and whiskey are aged in barrels, but you
          might not know that the traditional sizes of the barrels are different for each beverage. Barrels are also related to other cask sizes, such as a hogshead
          and a tun. We are going to focus on the wine cask units, where a tun is 210 gallons, there are 4 hogsheads per tun, and 2 barrels per hogshead. Convert
          the quantities of barrels and hogsheads to gallons.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If Grandpa Simpson's car gets forty rods to the hogshead, how many miles per gallon is he getting? Is this good or bad? How many barley seeds per tun
          does he get?
        </p>

      These questions will ask you to reflect on your experiences doing these calculations.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          You calculated the number of poppy seeds in 2 miles. If you were to line up that many poppy seeds, do you expect the actual total length to be close to
          2 miles? Why or why not?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It is likely that there was never a direct connection between the lengths of grains of barley and furlongs. Why do you think this is the case?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do you think that the units of rods, chains, and furlongs is more or less "logical" than feet, inches, and miles? What features do you think make for a
          "logical" system of measurements?
        </p>
