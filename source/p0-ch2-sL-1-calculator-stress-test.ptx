    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>
      Math teachers used to tell students that they needed to learn their arithmetic because they wouldn't always have a calculator in their pocket. But it turns out
      that those teachers were wrong. However, this doesn't mean that everyone really understands how to use their calculator, or that every calculator is the same.
      This lab activity will have you use a number of different types of calculators and try to identify particular quirks that they may have.

    <title>Procedure</title>

    <p>
      We are going to investigate the calculators and learn about their individual quirks. You will want to take notes throughout
      so that you will be able to remember the information you need for the write-up.
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Determine the following information about the two cellphone calculators and three online calculators:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Basic calculator information (cellphone calculators only): Determine the cell phone brand, calculator name, and calculator version. (Note: The
              calculator might just be called "calculator." The version information might be difficult to find, but it's there somewhere. You might find the
              information in the app store.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Calculator type: Basic or scientific. (Note: Some calculators allow you to use either mode. If so, indicate this and use scientific mode for the
              rest of the lab.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Execution style: Infix or immediate execution
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Parentheses, square, and square root: Determine whether the calculator allows the use of parentheses, the squaring function, and the square root function.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Scientific Notation: Determine whether the calculator accepts scientific notation. (Note: If the calculator is infix and has an exponentiation function,
              then you can use scientific notation. But some calculators will have an E or EE button for scientific notation.)
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We will use the calculators to calculate some values. The purpose is to compare the relative difficulty of getting the correct answers. In some cases,
          you might be able to perform the entire calculation in a single step. But in other cases, you may need to perform multiple separate calculations to get
          the correct result. Be sure to make note of any challenges you encounter.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Calculate <m>\frac{10}{5+5}</m>. The correct result is 10.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Calculate <m>1 + 2 \cdot 3</m>. The correct result is 7.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Calculate <m>2 + \frac{6}{3} + 3</m>. The correct result is 7.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We will now calculate values using actual physics formulas with physically appropriate values. This will help us to see the types of
          challenges these calculators may face in actual practice. (Descriptions of the formulas are given, but it's okay if you don't understand them
          right now.)
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              FILL THIS IN AFTER COMPLETING MORE OF THE TEXT
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We will now test some of the limits of the calculators. Perform the following tasks on each calculator.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Calculate <m>1 \div 3</m> and count the total number of digits that are displayed (including the leading zero). Then calculate <m>1,000,000 \div 3</m>
              and count the number of digits that are displayed. Indicate whether there are more, fewer, or the same number of digits in the display.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Determine the highest power of 10 that the calculator will accept without giving an error. This is easiest on calculators that have exponentiation or
              scientific notation. If it does not have these features, it will be helpful to use the "Ans" feature (uses the answer of the last calculation as part of the
              next calculation) or the memory feature to store large powers of ten. Make a note of the error it gives when it breaks.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If the calculator has a square root function, determine the maximum number of 9s needed for the calculator to display that <m>\sqrt{0.999\ldots9} = 1</m>.
              (Note: It is possible that for some calculators, it will not display this result even for a large number of 9s. If that happens on one of your calculators,
              just indicate this.)
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We will now engage in some "stress tests" of the calculators. The goal is to see whether we can make the calculator make mistakes. Note that if the instruction
          says to "calculate" a quantity, it means to have the calculator evaluate the result by pressing the equal sign (or equivalent button).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Calculate <m>1 + 2 \times 3</m>. Do not add parentheses or make other adjustments to force the calculator to get the right answer. We want to see
              how the calculator interprets this. The correct answer is 7, but some calculators will give 9 as the answer.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Calculate <m>1 \div 3</m> and then multiply that result by <m>3</m>. The correct answer is 1, but not all calculators will give this result.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Calculate <m>\sqrt{0.999\ldots9}</m> with as many 9s are needed to give a result of 1. Then square the result. The correct answer is <m>0.999\ldots9</m>
              with as many 9s as you entered when you started. However, some calculators will have rounding error and simply return a value of 1.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For calculators with a squaring function and a square root function, start with <m>0.1</m> and square as many times as needed to get a result of 0. Then
              take the square root. The correct answer is a very small positive one, but some calculators will give 0. For calculators that give a small positive number
              square twice and take the square root twice to see if it makes a difference. Continue squaring more and more times until it gets stuck at 0.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For calculators that have parentheses and inline notation (so that fractions appear as <m>1 \div 3</m> or <m>1 / 3 </m> instead of <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>), 
              calculate <m>6 \div 2 (1 + 2)</m>. If the calculator does not give an error, indicate what answer it gave. (Note: This calculation is hotly debated on
              the internet, and it is known that different calculators give different answers. What the "right" answer is and whether there even a "right" answer
              depends on who you ask.)

      Answer the following questions.

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Based on your experiences, which calculator would you say is the "best" one? The "worst" one? (Note: It's possible for multiple calculators to tie for best or
          worst. This is purely subjective.) What are your reasons for your rankings? Also indicate if there is disagreement within the group about these answers.
        </p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    
    <p>
      It's a common assumption that everyone knows how to use a calculator. This assumption is true for very basic calculations, but it's often false when
      more complex calculations are involved. Was there anything new that you learned about calculators from this activity?
