      Scientific notation is a way of representing numbers that are very large or very small in a way that helps us to work with and interpret the
      numbers much more easily. This is best exhibited by an example. Which number is larger: 705745422424033592 or 70574542424033591? As you try
      to compare the digits, you can start to see the difficulty of working with very large numbers in this form. If you were clever, you might
      have tried to count the number of digits in each number, and that's the basic insight of scientific notation.

      A number is in <term>scientific notation</term> if it is of the form <m>N \times 10^m</m>, where <m>1 \leq N &lt; 10</m> and <m>m</m> is an integer.
      We call <m>N</m> the <term>coefficient</term> and <m>m</m> the <term>exponent</term>. In contrast to scientific notation is <term>standard notation</term>,
      which is simply writing numbers the way we normally do.      
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick way to interpret a number in scientific notation is to look at the exponent. Numbers with positive exponents are typically "big" numbers
      and numbers with negative exponents are typically "small" numbers. The words "big" and "small" in quotes because we need to keep in mind that some
      of the work of the "size" consideration is being done by the units, and there's no absolute scale that we can use.

    <title>Converting To and From Scientific Notation</title>

    <p>
      The conversion to and from scientific notation follows from the fact that multiplying and dividing by 10 simply moves the decimal point to the
      left or to the right. However, we will want to avoid using the division symbol, so we will write division using negative exponents.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Multiplying and Dividing by 10</title>

      <md>
        <mrow>123.456 \times 10 \amp = 1234.56 \quad \text{Move the decimal one space right}</mrow>
        <mrow>123.456 \times 10^{-1} \amp = 12.3456 \quad \text{Move the decimal one space left}</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
    <p>
      When converting a number from scientific notation to standard notation, the size of the exponent tells you how many places to move the decimal and
      the sign (positive or negative) of the exponent tells you which direction you need to move the decimal point. Positive exponents move the decimal
      to the right (it makes the number bigger) and negative exponents move the decimal to the left (it makes the number smaller). When you do this, you
      may need to insert zeros between the decimal point and the digits you started with as placeholders. We're using the fact that exponents
      represent repeated multiplication, so that (for example) multiplying by <m>10^3</m> means multiplying by 10 three times, which would move the decimal
      three spaces to the right (one for each multiplication by 10).
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>From Scientific Notation to Standard Notation</title>

      <md>
        <mrow>1.234 \times 10^7 \amp = 12340000 \quad \text{Move the decimal seven spaces right}</mrow>
        <mrow>1.234 \times 10^{-5} \amp = 0.00001234 \quad \text{Move the decimal five spaces left}</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>

    <p>
      When converting a number from standard notation to scientific notation, we will follow a mechanical process. To get the coefficient, think of the
      given number as string of digits without a decimal point, and put the decimal point to the right of the leading digit (the left-most non-zero digit)
      and drop all the unnecessary zeros. Then to determine the exponent, think about where the decimal point you created would need to go to get back the
      original number, and use the corresponding value.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>From Standard Notation to Scientific Notation</title>

      <p>
        Converting 1234000 to scientific notation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Place the decimal to the right of the leading digit and drop the unnecessary zeros: 1.234
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Determine how the decimal must move to restore the original number: 1.234 <m>\rightarrow</m> 1234000 requires moving the decimal point
            6 places to the right.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Write the number with the corresponding exponent: <m>1234000 = 1.234 \times 10^6</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Place the decimal to the right of the leading digit and drop the unnecessary zeros: 5.6789
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Determine how the decimal must move to restore the original number: 5.6789 <m>\rightarrow</m> 0.000056789 requires moving the decimal point
            5 places to the left.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Write the number with the corresponding exponent: <m>0.000056789 = 5.6789 \times 10^{-5}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <title>Calculations with Scientific Notation</title>

    <p>
      Some calculators are capable of handling scientific notation. You would want to look for a button that has an EE or EXP on it, and you would want
      to find a tutorial (or experiment with the calculator) to make sure that you understand how to use it properly. But while you could use such a
      calculator to do your calculations, it is still important to understand the basic logic that goes on behind it.
