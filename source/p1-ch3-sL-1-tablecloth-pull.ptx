  <title>Tablecloth Pull Trick</title>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>
      You've probably seen it. The entertainer walks up to a table setting and pulls the tablecloth out from underneath it without knocking anything over.
      Of course, it's all physics. At the top level, this is a story about Newton's First and Second Laws of Motion. Objects that are at rest will remain
      at rest unless acted on by an external force, and <m>F = ma</m>. It's impossible to move the cloth away from the dishes without exerting any force, so
      there will always be some movement. This means that the challenge is to try to control that force as much as possible to minimize the acceleration
      of the dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will always be at least two forces acting on the dishes. There will always be gravity pulling the dishes downward, and there will be a friction force
      that opposes the cloth from sliding out from under the dishes. In some cases, there may be an additional force between the fabric and the dishes, depending
      on the angle that the fabric is making with the table.

    <title>Procedure</title>

    <p>
        The first part of this lab is going to be learning about all the ways this trick can go wrong. Then you will have a chance to practice the technique
        before we start adjusting the parameters.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mark a spot 10 cm from one of the edges with the fabric chalk or a small piece of tape. Then make another mark about 20 cm from the opposite edge. Each
          time you do the experiment, you will be placing the cup with a few weights* in it at the 10 cm mark and have the tablecloth so that there is about
          20 cm hanging off the side of the table. This will help with the consistency of the observations. (*Once you've decided how much weight to add, you should
          use the same amount every time until the assignment asks you to vary this.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          One of the techniques that people try to use for this trick is to pull the cloth towards their body. This will almost always fail. Record yourself doing
          this (using slow motion), making sure to focus your attention on the glass and the tablecloth near the cup. Watch the footage of the instant the tablecloth
          starts to move near the cup. Make some observations about what you see and why this is not a good technique.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The correct technique is to pull the cloth downward, against the edge of the table. But even then, you need to be careful. Some people hold their hands up
          above the height of the table before pulling down. Record yourself doing this a couple times (in slow motion). Watch the footage of the instant the table
          cloth starts to move near the cup. Watch the footage of the instant the tablecloth starts to move near the cup. Make some observations about what you see
          and why this is not a good technique.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The correct technique is to pull the cloth straight downward to avoid the problems you observed. And, while it may seem obvious, you need to do this
          quickly. Record yourself pull downward slowly on the cloth. You should be going slowly enough that the cup does not slide. You should be able to explain
          why the speed matters using the relationship between the coefficients of static friction and kinetic friction.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The correct technique is to pull the cloth straight downard very quickly. At this point, you've studied the most common errors and you should practice the
          trick until you feel comfortable that you can do it consistently.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do the trick again, but this time remove all of the weights so that you have only an empty cup. Try this experiment again a few times. Does this seem
          easier or harder to do? Record yourself and make observations about the movement of the cup that can help explain what's happening.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do the trick again, but this time add at least twice as much weight as you initially had to the cup. Try this experiment again a few times. Does this seem
          easier or harder to do? Try to explain what's happening.

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Draw a free body diagram for the cup for the times that you pulled the table towards your body. Pay attention to the angle that the fabric is making
          with the table. Explain how this diagram demonstrates why this technique will not work.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Explain the observations that you made when you held your hands above the table before pulling downward. In particular, discuss the interaction
          between the fabric and the cup, and how this interaction leads to problems.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Draw a free body diagram for what happens when you pull cloth slowly, making sure to use the formula for friction. Explain why you are using the
          coefficient of static friction in that diagram even though the cup is moving.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When we started altering the weights, we were creating a mixture of effects. On the one hand, increasing the mass means increasing the intertia
          and the cup has a larger tendency to stay still. On the other hand, increasing the mass also means increasing the friction. And increased friction
          should make it harder to pull the cloth away from the cup. In your experiences, do these two effects cancel each other out, or was one more impactful
          than the other? Try your best to explain this. (Note: This is a difficult task. Do your best!)

      This parlor trick has some interesting physics embedded in it. Hopefully, you were able to appreciate and understand that better based on your experiences
      with it.
