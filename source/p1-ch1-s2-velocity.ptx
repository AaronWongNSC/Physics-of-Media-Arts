      It is highly probable that you have some basic intuition about speed just based on your general life experiences. The goal for this sections is not
      so much about teaching you something new, but helping you to formalize that intuition and make it more concrete.

    <title>Speed vs. Velocity</title>

    <p>
      <idx><h>speed</h></idx>
      <idx><h>velocity</h></idx>

      <term>Speed</term> is a number that measures of how fast something is moving. <term>Velocity</term> is a vector that indicates how fast something is moving and
      in which direction. Under this framework, the magnitude of velocity is the speed, and speed is never a negative value. In common usage, speed and velocity
      are often interchangeable. However, from the definitions you can see that they are not interchangable in physics courses. So just be aware of the distinction
      and do your best to practice being precise in your language.

    <title>Defining Velocity</title>

    <p>
      Although we have a lot of experience with velocity, it takes a bit of thought to translate those experiences into something formal. In order for there to be
      velocity, there must be some amount of motion. And that motion will require an amount of time. Velocity is made up of the ratio of those two quantities.
      Specifically, we define velocity as <m>v = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}</m>, where <m>\Delta s</m> is the change in position during the observed movement, and
      <m>\Delta t</m> is the amount of time the movement took.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Basic Velocity Calculation: Driving to the Beach</title>
      
      <p>
        Suppose you are going to drive to the beach. Let's say that leave the house at 7 AM and arrive at the beach 9 AM and the beach is 120 miles away from your home.
        Your change in position is 120 miles and the amount of time it took for you to complete that change of position is 2 hours. Therefore, we would say that your
        velocity for the trip was <m>v = \frac{120 \text{ milse}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hours}}</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      This formula is often rewritten as <m>\Delta s = v \cdot \Delta t</m>, or more simply as <m>d = vt</m>.

    <title>Average and Instantaneous Velocity</title>

    <p>
      <idx><h>velocity, average</h></idx>

      Technically, this formula gives us the <term>average velocity</term>. The reason is that this calculation doesn't take into account all of the nuances of what
      happens between the start and end of the motion. In the example, it's probably the case that the car stopped somewhere along the way (at a stop sign or traffic
      light), and at that moment the car was not moving at 60 miles per hour. Simiarly, it's likely that the car was driving faster than 60 mph on the freway. But because
      the elapsed time is so large, all of those details are lost and we are only left with the overall picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <idx><h>velocity, instantaneous</h></idx>

      Another way to think about the velocity is to try to keep track of all of those details. Rather than just thinking about the starting and stopping times and positions,
      we want to know what was happening at every moment of the trip. We would call that the <term>instantaneous velocity</term>. It's not hard to imagine creating a chart
      of values for velocity at specific times along the trip, similar to how we can create a chart of the position at any time. However, there's an interesting question
      that arises from this. What do we even mean by "velocity at a specific time"? How would we measure it? Velocity requires movement, and movement requires time, so we
      will always need both a start time and a stop time for any measurement, and they can't be the same. This brings us back to the arrow paradox!

    </p>
    <p>
      We will say more about this in a later section, but the if we practically want to try to get instantaneous velocity, we need to collect data in small enough
      increments that any change in velocity between the start and stop time is "small enough" to be ignored.
