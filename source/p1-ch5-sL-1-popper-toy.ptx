    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>
      Although it is a simple toy, the popper toy is complicated enough to have some interesting physics.

    <title>Procedure</title>

    <p>
      Our goal is to try to measure as much information about the physics of the popper toy as possible, and then we'll put a marble in the popper toy and
      see whether we can make sense of the dynamics when using the popper toy as a launcher.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Weigh the popper toy and marble in grams. (Note: These grams are a unit of force and not mass! We'll deal with that later.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Record the popper toy up-close in slow motion and launch it several times. Determine the time it takes for the popper to invert (after it starts moving).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Record the popper toy up-close next to a meter stick and launch it several times. Determine the initial velocity of the popper when it leaves the surface. The toy
          is not completely consistent, so you will end up with a variety of values. The goal is to get three good measurements.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Record the popper toy at a larger distance and launch it several times. Estimate the maximum height that the popper attains. (Try to get the measurement on 
          "mostly vertical" launches.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Record the popper toy with a marble in it up-close in slow motion and launch it several times. Determine the time it takes for the popper to invert (after
          it starts moving).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place the marble in the popper toy and record it up-close next to a meter stick. Determine the initial velocity of the marble.

    <title>Discussion</title>
      
    <p>
      We are going to study the dynamics of the popper toy.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use the fact that <m>F = ma</m> to determine the mass of the popper toy and marble. (Note: You will need to convert grams-force to kilograms-force and use the
          correct value of <m>a</m> to get the mass.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using the launch speed of the popper and its mass, determine its initial momentum.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use <m>\Delta p = F \Delta t</m> to determine the average force that the popper exerts on the surface when it is popping.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use the equations for projectile motion to calculate the expected height of the popper given its initial speed. How does this compare to what you measured?

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Compare this result to the initial momentum of the popper on its own. What conclusions can you draw from these results?
